"1023021","2012-11-21 09:59:14","NeoStem Awarded $1.2 Million Grant For VSEL Development","<p>Very Small Embryonic-Like (VSEL) stem cells could be one of NeoStem's (NBS) most promising clinical products in its pipeline, but it has yet to see an aggressive plan towards clinical development. Stem cells, which reside in adult tissues, were discovered by <a href=""https://louisville.edu/bucksforbrains/faculty/ratajczak"">Dr. Mariusz Ratajczak</a>, an internationally known specialist in the field of adult stem cell biology. They possess the ability to differentiate and develop into multiple tissue types and are showing promise in treating injuries, heart disease, inflammation and a host of other ailments. Since their discovery, VSEL stem cells have been <a href=""http://stemcellassays.com/2012/04/human-vsel-real-thing/"">isolated</a> from a few mouse and human tissues and then tested in disease models, but have yet to advance on a large-scale trial. VSELs are being regarded as the answer to the moral and ethical concerns associated with embryonic stem cells as they also have the ability to differentiate into multiple tissue types but are found in adult bone marrow and umbilical cord blood.</p><p>On Tuesday morning, NeoStem advanced VSEL technology when it <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/neostem-receives-notification-1-2-123000563.html"">announced</a> that it has received a grant to move forward with the clinical study of VSELs in a Phase 2 trial, which will be the very first NIH approved clinical study of VSELs in humans. This is another win for cell therapy and, more specifically, NeoStem. The company is well positioned as a cell therapy leader and is solidifying itself with this two-year grant totaling $1,221,854. The grant comes from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) for the Phase 2 SBIR submission &quot;Repair of Bone Defects with Human Autologous Pluripotent Very Small Embryonic-Like Stem Cells (VSELs).&quot; This development means that NeoStem is moving forward with clinical studies for this promising therapy, and that the company will add to its AMR-001 clinical development and its manufacturing segment. Accordingly, NeoStem is becoming more diversified and a safer investment in this rapidly growing space.</p><p>In the first human trial using VSELs, NeoStem will be attempting to treat periodontitis. According to the company's press release, periodontal disease is prevalent in the U.S. and affects up to 90% of the world population. The most severe case affects between 15 and 47 million Americans. The company is choosing to test VSELs on this indication most likely because of its large market potential, but also because it is believed that periodontal inflammation could have a role in the initiation or progression of coronary heart disease and stroke. NeoStem investors know that the company's lead product, AMR-001, treats patients following a heart attack. Appropriately, the two have great synergy and could allow the company to create massive sales in the cardiovascular space, which is considered the most promising with the most research of any segment in regenerative medicine.</p><p>For those of you who are unfamiliar with NeoStem's VSEL Technology, it is believed to aid in treating a variety of conditions (following initial studies), which include traumatic wound healing, osteoporosis through bone regeneration, liver regeneration, regeneration of some motor neurons, and also radiation exposure, among other possible treatments. Last month, the company announced the first piece of data that we have seen in regards to this technology. The company <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/neostem-announces-very-small-embryonic-113000260.html"">announced</a> that its stem cells successfully <em>created bone</em> when implanted in the bone tissue of SCID mice. This development further solidifies the potential of VSELs and presents the company with a large window of opportunity, as there are many diseases that could benefit from bone regenerative capabilities.</p><p>The VSEL Technology will most likely not treat all of the above conditions on a large scale; yet it's still encouraging that it has shown a clinical benefit in these areas and that there is research to suggest it is effective as a new form of treatment-and a safer form as well. The company has received numerous grants and donations for the research and development of VSELs from various partners and supporters. On the <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/clinical-development/vsel.html"">company's website</a>, NeoStem lists some of these investments into the research and development of the VSEL Technology. It specifically mentions $1.7 million from the Department of Defense for osteoporosis, another $700,000 from the U.S. Army for traumatic wound healing, and nearly $700,000 from the National Institute of Health for various purposes. And now the company has added its most significant award yet from the NIDCR that will provide over $1.2 million for advancing clinical studies into human trials, and will cover the costs associated with an Investigational New Drug ((IND)) submission to the FDA. Therefore, due to grants, NeoStem has had to spend much less of its own money; but as it advances in late-stage trials, investors should watch for even more support and greater funding for the development of this technology.</p><p>In addition to government support for the VSEL Technology, the company makes mention of the Vatican, which chose NeoStem as an exclusive partner in adult stem cell research and awareness, in part based on VSEL Technology. Other supporters also include several universities, such as University of California, Michigan, Rutgers, and of course Louisville (Dr. Ratajczak's place of research). Thus, we can conclude that there are a lot of people and organizations that are betting on the success of this new yet innovative form of cell therapy; and now it can grow beyond the preclinical phase and enter into a new era of development that could change the outlook for the company and sector.</p><p>Yesterday's news was exciting for NBS and for those who follow the space. We will now be able to learn more about what appears to be a promising therapy. I look forward to more independent studies that may show if more potential exists, as some <a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3adoi/10.1371/journal.pone.0034899"">research</a> suggests several important markers exist on VSEL cells, but more research is needed. According to the press release, the company plans to move forward very quickly and to explore the possibilities in the next six months to develop a &quot;plan of action.&quot; Until then the company will continue to develop its lead product candidate cell therapy, AMR-001, and provide contract manufacturing organization ((CMO)) services to several late-stage promising companies, which is another good point.</p>   <p>Some might express concerns that developing VSELs will increase the company's cost and increase the likelihood for financing. The good news is that the grant will cover the initial expenses, and because of the company's partners/supporters, it is likely that more funding will be presented. However, if not, then the company does have enough cash and the leverage available at the moment. It had $7.9 million of cash at quarter's end, but the company also just <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/neostem-closes-divestiture-ownership-interest-140743290.html"">closed the sale</a> of its Chinese generic pharmacy, which provided cash and eliminated debt. The sale of the pharmacy gives NeoStem $12.3 million in cash, eliminates $33 million in debt, and with <a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/e/121113/nbs10-q.html"">sales growth of more than 100%</a> year-over-year, the company looks well-positioned to add VSELs to its pipeline of products being developed without having to further dilute its shares.</p><p>Other authors have discussed the fact that NeoStem has manufactured every cell type, and that it has the best staff in the business in regards to the development of clinical candidates. When combined, it makes this newest development very encouraging, as NeoStem's experience allows it to know what works, what doesn't, and what will be effective-and it looks as if NeoStem and its many supporters believe VSELs could be an essential part of bringing cell therapies to the forefront of medical procedures. Only time will tell if retail and institutional investors will follow suit and begin investing more of their money in the promising company that the aforementioned entities have already deemed worthy of their funds.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[NBS]].

(SIRI):</strong> Shares of Sirius XM moved higher towards the end of last week after CNBC's Jim Cramer <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/46668373?__source=yahoo%7Cheadline%7Cquote%7Ctext%7C&amp;par=yahoo"">interviewed</a> Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin on Thursday evening's airing of 'Mad Money'. The interview marked a stark turnaround for Cramer, who had been bearish on the company for years. During the interview, both he and Karmazin painted a rosy picture for the current and future state of Sirius, emphasizing the growing free cash flow that, they argued, will continue to enhance the value of the company.</p><p>The growing subscriber base was also highlighted, as was the rebound in new car sales that is expected to continue to add new subscriptions - and therefore revenue - to the company's bottom line.</p><p>As a result of the pretty picture painted by the two, SIRI shares closed Friday at $2.35, just a penny below the high for the day, and significantly higher than the $1.84 price that opened the year.</p><p>The Cramer pump was a solid follow-up to the fourth quarter earnings numbers - <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-weekly-stock-watch-nviv-pcyc-cpst-ttnp-imuc-siri-gltc-celh-cvm-imsc"">announced</a> last month - that reinvigorated the move higher, and investors may now have more of a warm and fuzzy feeling than at any point since the collapse of a few years ago that saw SIRI trade for a nickel.</p><p>With that being said, there's still reason for investors to remain on their toes regarding the short and long term future of this stock. The longs and shorts have <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/275882-sirius-xm-as-shorts-and-longs-battle-it-out-who-wins-the-war"">battled it out</a> for quite some time, and as argued before, there are still cases to be made for both sides of the fence.</p><p>Although a &quot;Cramer Pump&quot; can lead to a quick rise in share price for a particular stock, it's also common to see those stocks take a dive shortly after the highs of the short term spike are reached following the positive mention. Once could use Oncothyreon (ONTY) as an example, a company that spiked after receiving a similar positive mention <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-onty-as-they-fly-they-too-can-fall-exciting-times-ahead"">last summer</a>, only to see shares slide back to previously-traded levels once the hype died down.</p><p>There is also concern among many Sirius investors as to why many insiders are exercising options and <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=SIRI+Insider+Transactions"">selling shares</a> at this time, <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/joanlappin/2012/02/26/sirius-xms-karmazin-suddenly-selling-half-his-stock-but-not-until-april/"">including</a> Karmazin himself, if the future of the company and its share price remains so bright. A little bit of insider selling should not cause alarm, as even the big boys need to realize some extra 'Grey Goose and Good Life' free cash flow once in a while, but the amount of shares being sold in SIRI right now is more than just noticeable.</p><p>The late-week Cramer interview has assured investors that the coming week should be an eventful and volatile one for shareholders of SIRI. Keep an eye on it and don't be afraid to keep an active trigger finger if shares start to slip as investors digest the insider selling and prospects that the best percentage price gains may already have passed.</p><p>Also take notice of SIRI's growing <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-09/largest-nasdaq-short-interest-positions-as-of-feb-29.html?cmpid=yhoo"">short interest</a>.</p><p><strong>Dendreon Corp. (DNDN):</strong> Although never closing below the mark last week, shares of Dendreon slipped below ten dollars again amid concerns that Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson's (JNJ) Zytiga was priming to mount a huge challenge to Provenge on the open market as a treatment for advanced prostate cancer.</p><p>A review by an independent monitoring committee confirmed the success of Zytiga in late stage trials and concluded that <em>&quot;it would be unethical to continue&quot;</em> the trial, according to statements <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/business/trial-shows-benefit-in-earlier-use-of-zytiga-for-prostate-cancer.html?partner=yahoofinance"">published</a> last week. The committee also <em>&quot;effectively ended the trial early so that the patients getting the placebo could be offered Zytiga instead.&quot;</em></p><p>The decision was a huge boost for JNJ and understandably contributed to the <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-in-spite-of-dendreon-s-woes-other-players-in-the-sector-are-starting-to-roll"">ongoing woes</a> of Dendreon, as Provenge is having enough trouble gaining significant traction without the competition of Zytiga.</p><p>It's been a volatile ride for DNDN, thus far into the new year, as early-February <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-dndn-the-surge-continues"">highs of nearly</a> seventeen dollars were quickly erased following the cautionary tone of company officials in the fourth quarter <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/395701-dendreon-s-ceo-discusses-q4-2011-results-earnings-conference-call?source=yahoo"">earnings call</a>, and the upcoming week should prove no different.</p><p>Investors who have loaded up on DNDN for below ten dollars have done well playing the short term peaks and valleys of this stock over the past year, but every time news such as last week's Zytiga threat hits the wires, long term investors grow a little more squeamish about the future of Provenge as potentially reaching the billion-dollar plateau that many once predicted.</p><p>A rebound could certainly be in store, especially if sales numbers continue to improve and additional Dendreon pipeline news materializes, but this company cannot shake the risk and volatility from its share price.</p><p>Continue to watch this one during the upcoming week.</p><p><strong>Lpath, Inc. (LPTN.OB):</strong> Shares of Lpath, Inc. (LPTN) took a <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/"">dramtic dive</a> this past Tuesday after the company announced a licensing deal that priced shares roughly twenty percent lower than the market price at the time. The pullback came on the heels of an announcement last month that Lpath's ongoing trials would be halted due to the fact that its finish/fill contractor was found to <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-lpath-dip-may-be-nothing-more-than-a-buying-opportunity"">not be in compliance</a> of some FDA-enforced standards.</p><p>While both of these events led to a swift decline in share price, all the bad news may be out of the way and LPTN could be primed to rebound back to the dollar mark in relatively quick fashion.</p><p>Lpath already has the foundations of success for a small company, given the large commitment by Pfizer (PFE) in its technology and its recognized status as the leader of a potentially groundbreaking field of medicine.</p><p>The ImmuneY2 platform has thrust Lpath into the forefront in the field of lipid-based therapeutics and is the only company to have taken the technology as far in development as it has. ImmuneY2 contains the ability to generate therapeutic antibodies that bind to and inhibit bioactive lipids that contribute to the spreading and growth of various diseases and inflammatory/auto-immune disorders. The market potential for this technology in treating a plethora of modern day illnesses and diseases, should it advance past the clinical stages, is huge, and Lpath is first applying its technology to the treatment of Wet AMD and cancer, both multi-billion dollar markets.</p><p>The recent pullback in share price has posed no threat to the Pfizer deal and is not related to the potential or effectiveness of Lpath's treatments, so it's not generally expected that this dip is going to last for too long.</p><p>A trial re-start may be just what this one needs to rebound.</p><p><strong>Human Genome Sciences (HGSI):</strong> A strong close on heavy volume Friday afternoon has investors of Human Genome Sciences looking forward to the coming trading week that could again push shares back towards the ten dollar mark.</p><p>Having pulled back following another <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-human-genome-hgsi-offers-short-and-long-term-potential-from-current-prices"">earnings report</a> that demonstrated a continued &quot;trial stage&quot; for HGSI's lupus drug, Benlysta, on the open market, shares were quick to rebound on Friday as - you guessed it - rumors again started swirling around the Internet that the company was set to become an <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-10-potential-buyout-candidates-siri-hgsi-dndn-cclr-cpst-lptn-ttnp-actc-siga-celh"">acquisition target</a> of its big-name partner from the U.K., GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).</p><p>Glaxo already has its hand deeply involved with HGSI through the Benlysta partnership, and never does a few months go by when the buyout speculation ramps up. Although Benlysta sales have been slow to ramp up, it's still widely expected that it will still eventually become a blockbuster, once Doctors are convinced that it is a viable alternative to other treatments on the market; therefore, it could be argued, it would make sense for Glaxo to strike early, and swallow up the remaining HGSI pipeline in the process.</p><p>Friday's late day spike resulted in a climb of more than ten percent in the closing minutes of trading and should lead to an interesting day on Monday, especially if there is something to this roudn of rumors or if a large media outlet picks up the story.</p><p>That said, this popular rumor has never panned out before, so it might be wise to stand by and play some trading shares into any pronounced spike.</p><p>Here we go again.</p><p><strong>Immunocellular Therapeutics (IMUC.OB):</strong> Immunocellular is another one that has recently demonstrated the current volatility of the markets. The new year opened with IMUC trading for near the dollar mark on the announcement of <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-imuc-with-financing-out-of-the-way-another-revival-could-be-in-store"">new financing</a>, but a sharp run backed by new <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-imuc-pipeline-potential-and-institutional-interest-fuel-rebound"">institutional interest</a> and talk of a move to the AMEX had shares touching the <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/417451-immunocellular-touches-3-on-continued-speculation?source=yahoo"">three dollar mark</a> before a pullback to the $2.50 range.</p><p>Immunocellular is straddling too popular fields right now with its technology of targeting cancer stem cells to prevent the growth and spreading of cancer, and should continue gaining increased attention as potential plans to move to a larger trading boards take shape.</p><p>It's also common to see investors take positions in developmental stage companies in the months prior to the release of trial results, and that could provide another catalyst for shares later this year, since initial results from the ongoing ICT-107 glioblastoma trial are due to start trickling in as soon as December.</p><p>The recent price run and <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-immunocellular-therapeutics-ushering-in-the-next-generation-of-cancer-immunotherapies"">strength of its technology</a> should continue to have IMUC shares in the spotlight for the coming week.</p><p><strong>Agenus, Inc. (AGEN):</strong> Agenus received quite the boost last week when it became wrapped up in <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-add-agenus-agen-to-the-growing-list-of-buyout-candidates"">buyout talks</a> of its own after the expansion of a partnership agreement with GlaxoSmithKline included a 'first right of refusal' clause for Glaxo in the event of an Agenus buyout.</p><p>The two are already married through a partnership for QS-21 Stimulon, a vaccine adjuvant being used in many of GSK's late stage vaccine candidates, and the two became even closer under the terms of the amended agreement, as outlined in a <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/agenus-expands-qs-21-license-133000187.html"">press release</a> issued early last week that stated:</p><blockquote><p><blockquote class=""quote""><p>&quot;<em>GSK will pay Agenus a non-refundable payment of $9 million, of which $2.5 million is creditable against future manufacturing technology transfer royalty payments. The agreement also includes royalty payments for an undisclosed indication upon commercialization of a vaccine product.&quot;</em></p></blockquote></p></blockquote><p>Agenus has been trading under the radar for quite some time as a Phase II Prophage trial for glioma progresses, but the growing association with a big player like Glaxo is sure to bring in additional attention for the company.</p><p>Keep in mind, however, Prophage is still a long way from market and QS-21 royalties alone will not be enough to bring this company to superstardom, so it may take continued buyout rumors for this one to sustain prices much higher than they are now for any extended period of time.</p><p>Volume was high last week, and the fact that AGEN is on the map again makes it a stock to watch.</p><p><strong>Oncothyreon:</strong> After a 40% haircut last week for Oncothyreon shares, investors were left to speculate as to whether or not the perceived success of the Phase III Stimuvax trials would actually pan out. Many had concluded that the trial might end earlier than expected if the interim results looked at recently by an independent monitoring committee were strong enough, and investors who had their hands in that basket were disappointment and rattled when events didn't pan out that way, although the committee did recommend that the trial continue.</p><p>Stimuvax is partnered with Germany's Merck KGaA (MKGAF.PK).</p><p>In a <a href=""http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2012/03/09/oncothyreon-ceo-investors-had-%e2%80%98unrealistic-expectations%e2%80%99/"">statement released</a> by Oncothyreon CEO Robert Kirkman last week, he noted that investors hoping for an early trial completion held <em>&quot;unrealistic expectations,&quot;</em> and that the continuation of the trial <em>&quot;should be viewed as a positive,&quot;</em> even though the expected release of the results has been pushed back into early 2013, vice the expected late 2012 expectations.</p><p>A year is very long time in today's fickle and volatile trading market, and many short term traders and investors have neither the time nor the inclination to sit around for that long waiting for results, which likely contributed to last week's swift share price decline.</p><p>Some of those investors may come back, however, towards the end of the year when another pre-results run-up could be expected, but the short term may not provide any price catalysts until then.</p><p>Should Stimuvax prove successful in these trials, and that is a subject being debated by some high profile investment websites right now, then ONTY could perform much as DNDN did after positive Provenge Phase III trials a few years back, but it's also worth noting that a full collapse would most likely be in store should the trial results not necessarily meet the endpoints.</p><p>As always, take advantage of any peaks and valleys that these speculative plays offer in order to reduce risk exposure and bank a few trading bucks.</p><p><strong>ALSO WATCH:</strong></p><p><strong>Peregrine Pharmaceuticals (PPHM):</strong> Shares of this developmental company slipped by over twenty percent on Friday after the company <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/peregrine-reports-data-phase-ii-130000428.html"">announced</a> that its trial-stage cancer drug bavituximab may not have provided the expected benefits of survival and progression in a mid stage non-small cell lung cancer trial.</p><p>Full results will be released later this year, but many investors are jumping ship after the less-than-encouraging initial look, although the company attempts to maintain a positive light in its <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/peregrine-pharma-falls-lung-cancer-184113844.html"">press release</a>.</p><p>It's a risky proposition right now, in my opinion, to try and jump in here in hopes of a rebound, but maybe keep it on the watch list for any potential positive developments.</p><p>At this point, however, I wouldn't count on it.</p><p><strong>Capstone Turbine (CPST):</strong> Capstone was on the slide last week after a recent <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/capstone-turbine-announces-equity-offering-134500574.html"">stock offering</a> priced shares at $1.11.</p><p>Orders for the company's low-emission microturbine units, on the other hand, have continued to come in at an encouraging rate and heavily contributed to another round of positive earnings growth for the last quarter as the company continues to trek towards profitability.</p><p>CPST does dip below the dollar mark from time to time, so that can be expected during any lull in significant news. Those moves are generally short-lived and are often followed by decent moves (in terms of percentages) to the $1.50 mark, so this stock may be back into buying territory.</p><p>Keep an eye on it for its short term rebound potential, with an eye also to the long term. Capstone's microturbines fit right into the green trend of evolving technology.</p><p><strong>OncoVista Innovative Therapies (OVIT.OB):</strong> OncoVista's <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-stock-watch-oncovista-innovative-therapies-ovit-still-moving"">quick move higher</a> was stalled late last week and on Friday shares fell ten percent and returned to the fifty cent mark. <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-oncovista-rising-in-volume-and-price-what-s-next-"">Volume and price</a> had been on the move and propelled OVIT to the north side of sixty cents for a short time, well more than double where shares had been trading just weeks before.</p><p>The pullback is likely a sign that many of the swing, momentum and day traders might have moved on looking for the next big, short term mover. It doesn't help that there has been no news released to support a sustained run - a stock can only move so much and for so long on speculation alone - and some may have seen the lack of news and quick reversal as a sign that the traders are finished and it's a waiting game again for OVIT.</p><p>Still worth watching, but it may take news at this point to see a push to the dollar range.</p><p><strong>McDonalds Corp (MCD):</strong> A slowdown in same-store sales had shares of McDonald's slip by a few percentage points during the mid week last week, and the company was also mentioned in reports of the &quot;Pink Slime&quot; that is used in U.S. ground beef. To be fair, McDonald's was only mentioned in the reports as having stopped using the substance, but any mention associated with the pink slime surely made investors - and consumers - a little sickly in the stomach region. Yum (YUM) has also stated that the company does not use the slime in its meat.</p><p>For those that have MCD in the long term or retirement portfolio, the pullback might be an opportune time to add a little bit. This stock has been at the hundred dollar mark very recently, and could return there rather quickly on the back of <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-major-us-restaurant-brands-gunning-for-international-growth"">positive international growth</a>, although there is the risk that another slip may materialize if a general market correction takes place.</p><p>Regardless, the Ronald gang is a powerhouse and it's doubtful consumers will stop buying cheap burgers any time soon - even with images of pink slime monsters running around in their heads.</p><p><strong>Keryx Biopharmaceuticals (KERX):</strong> The Keryx saga continues to <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-keryx-biopharmaceuticals-the-pre-decision-runup-is-in-full-effect"">play out in the headlines</a> as shares continue to trade for over bucks. The debates about the success of failure of the Phase III Perifisone trial should be dominating the Keryx headlines right now, but it's the statements and credibility of various Internet bloggers that is stealing the thunder. With the meat and potatoes of the company no longer ruling the day, it's tough to stick around to see this one play out. A nice trading opportunity was already realized here, so it might be wise to pull a few profitable shares from the table.</p><p><strong>Advanced Cell Technology (ACTC.OB):</strong> Back to trading for a dime, it might also be a time to jump back in on Advanced Cell Technologies. Fresh off an <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-actc-ringing-in-the-new-year-with-a-bang"">early-year run</a> that culminated in a solid mention in 'The Economist', Advanced Cell has been gaining acclaim for the early success of its RPE stem cell-based treatment for severe vision loss.</p><p>Although falling below a dime at times still, ten cents has been the general re-load time of late. It's always one to keep on the radar for both the potential of its stem cell therapies, but also because a buyout could materialize quickly.</p><p>With Geron (GERN) currently removed from the stem cell research game, ACT is arguably the recognized leader in the field.</p><p><em>Happy Trading ...</em></p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[LPTN.OB]], [[IMUC.OB]], [[MCD]], [[AGEN]], [[ACTC.OB]], [[HGSI]], [[OVIT.OB]], [[CPST]].</p>"
"794081","2012-08-09 11:16:53","Riding The Ups And Downs Among Biopharmaceutical Companies","<p>As a group, the <a href=""http://www.google.com/finance?catid=us-52981623"">biotechnology and drug sector</a> has had an impressive YTD run, well outperforming the S&amp;P 500. The NASDAQ Biotech Index <a href=""http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/nbi/stock-chart"">(BMI)</a> is up over 25% YTD, while the S&amp;P 500 has seen gains of just under 9% YTD. When one researches the smaller upstart biotech companies that are not included in the BMI, there are considerable risks that deter many investors. Yet, if one chooses the right company, there are truly great rewards. Unfortunately, most investors miss out on such opportunities, whether it was because the company flew under the radar until a positive announcement sent the stock upward, or the investors were unable to effectively utilize their standard stock evaluations that they would normally use in evaluating a more established company. Below are three companies in which looking at the book value does little good, but they might just be hidden gems waiting to be discovered.</p><p>Advanced Medical Isotope Corporation (ADMD.OB), a nano company with a market cap of $21.6 million, may be one of those companies that is a gem waiting to be discovered. The company recently signed a licensing agreement with <a href=""http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/news.html?d=251532"">Batelle</a> to develop a high-dose radiation therapy technology known as radiogel. Battelle is the world's largest independent research and development organization. It licensed the technology to Advanced Medical Isotope Corporation (hereafter AMIC) which included eight patents comprising the injectable radiogel technology, a water-based biodegradable polymer that delivers yttrium-90 microspheres directly into cancer tumors. <a href=""http://radiographics.rsna.org/content/25/suppl_1/S41.full"">Yttrium-90</a> is a well established medical isotope with numerous applications in the treatment of cancer.</p><p><a href=""http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2018049002_grant26m.html"">Radiogel</a> is a new technology that injects the radioactive isotope product into the body and delivers a high dose of radiation, killing the cancer cells. What makes radiogel stand out from other treatments is that the polymer, when first injected into the targeted cancer site, is in liquid form - but the liquid warms quickly to the body temperature and polymerizes at the injection site. The polymer lattice formed traps the yttrium-90 microspheres in place as the high energy beta particles irradiate cancer cells in the target mass. This targeted radiation approach maximizes the radiation dose of the cancer cells while minimizing exposure to nearby normal tissues. Effectiveness of the treatment is thus maximized as is the safety profile.</p><p>Because it can be administered through the skin or during surgery, the procedure has the ability to be delivered to solid tumors that cannot be removed safely. Radiogel appears to have numerous applications including cancers of the liver, brain, head and neck, kidney, and pancreas, plus it is showing promise for eye tumors. &quot;<a href=""http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2018049002_grant26m.html"">We expect</a> the radiogel to become a therapeutic agent that provides physicians with the ability to effectively treat tumors that cannot be removed surgically or that cannot be treated by any other means,&quot; said Robert Schenter, chief scientific officer for AMIC.</p><p>Since early June, AMIC's common stock has risen from $0.09 to just under $0.30 a share, roughly a 200% increase. The rise clearly coincided with the announcement of the licensing agreement with Battelle, but that might not be the only reason for the boost in the stock price. The <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-q-advanced-medical-isotope-corp-2012-05-14"">demand</a> for medical isotopes is on the rise. In the US alone, 18 million medical procedures use medical isotopes, with a growth rate estimated to increase at 10% annually. Consider this: 90% of all the non <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-q-advanced-medical-isotope-corp-2012-05-14"">PET radioisotopes</a> used in the United States are imported, and the remaining 10% that are produced in the United States are manufactured in a fragmented, piecemeal manner with companies producing a single isotope instead of a wide variety. Hence, there is plenty of room for an American isotope company that can produce a wide array of products to make a major dent in the market. AMIC might just be that company with a wide range of <a href=""http://www.isotopeworld.com/isotope-products/"">medical isotope products</a> available and being developed.</p><p>AMIC is projecting that if they can get their radiogel to market in 2013, annual sales could reach $5-$15 million, with a growth of future sales reaching upwards of $75-$100 million in the US alone. Given that the global isotope market continues to grow and is expected to reach $4.7 billion by 2015, if AMIC can produce the numbers they are projecting, this little company may just be the next big mover for speculative investors. However, use caution as there are landmines in this field. The stock is moved at this time not by its slim earnings, but by future possible revenue as seen by the stock's price increase after announcing their licensing deal with Battelle.</p><p><strong>Ziopharm O</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>cology Inc. (ZIOP)</strong> is a biopharmaceutical company developing small molecule and synthetic biological approaches to new cancer therapies that treat tumors of the bone, cartilage and muscle by targeting cellular pathways to halt the development of cancer cells. Due to positive developments for the company, it has traded up as much as 43% YTD. However, it has had a rocky 30 days for investors, giving back most of its gains it had attained. There was some positive news coming out of this New York based company that may make investors interested in taking a closer look. Earlier this month, Ziopharm's cancer drug, Palifosfamide, which is in phase 3 clinical trials for first-line metastatic soft tissue sarcoma and first-line metastatic small cell lung cancer, was granted a patent by the US Patent and Trademark office. <a href=""http://dmnnewswire.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=2133408"">Ceaser J. Belbel</a>, Ziopharm's Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, commented on the patent: &quot;The issuance of this patent further strengthens our U.S. patent position for our lead candidate, Palifosfamide, which already has composition of matter exclusivity through 2029&hellip; further strengthening of our robust patent portfolio, specifically for this compound, is important to Ziopharm as we move forward with pivotal and other studies in soft tissue sarcoma, small cell lung cancer, and other potential indications.&quot; Success in either of the two phase 3 trials, combined with this patent protection, not only shields the company somewhat from competition during the protection period, but it also makes the company a valuable acquisition target for big pharma looking to increase or start their own oncological programs.</p><p>Ziopharm Oncology released its earnings data on Thursday Aug 6th, reporting earnings of $0.29 per share ((EPS)) for the second quarter, though the company's revenue was 0% on a year-over-year basis. However, one should look at other variables in evaluating most biopharmaceutical companies involved in R&amp;D including this one. For example, operational cash spent for the second quarter was $16.8 million, an increase of $11 million for the same period of 2011. The increased spending, driving this small cap company's <a href=""http://www.macroaxis.com/invest/ratio/ZIOP--Cash_Flow_from_Operations"">cash flow</a> from operations below the healthcare and biotechnology sector's, was due to R&amp;D for Palifosfamide's pivotal phase 3 studies and their DNA-based therapeutics <a href=""http://www.ziopharm.com/pipeline/home"">AD-IL-12 and DC-IL-12</a> that are in phase 1 clinicals. The company also has Orphan Drug Designation for Palifosfamide in the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in both the United States and the European Union. <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DevelopingProductsforRareDiseasesConditions/HowtoapplyforOrphanProductDesignation/default.htm"">Orphan Drug Designation</a> qualifies the sponsor of the product for tax credits and marketing incentives through the Orphan Drug Act. In its phase 3 trials, Palifosfamide appears to be very encouraging. With R&amp;D Biopharmaceutical companies, sometimes all it takes is positive news, whether in clinical trials or new patents being granted, to send the stock soaring higher. Although Ziopharm is hovering around $5.26, 15% below its 52 week high of $6.33, Jefferies and JP Morgan earlier this year raised its target price to $7.00 a share. With this biopharmaceutical company perhaps on the edge of more positive news, and if they can continue to make positive strides with Palifosfamide and their DNA based therapeutics, this stock could meet or exceed the analyst target price.</p><p><strong>Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. (HALO)</strong>, a small cap biotechnology company based in San Diego CA, has rebounded nicely after last week's stock plunge of over 50% of its value. The stock fell from $8.56 to a low of $3.89 per share on heavy volume when the company announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter regarding their co-developed drug, HyQ, for treatment of primary immunodeficiency disease. Volume continued to be very heavy over the next couple of trading sessions, averaging well over 2 million shares as the bears and bulls slugged it out over this company's stock.</p><p>HyQ is a combination of Baxter International's (BAX) plasma-derived Immune Globulin and Halozyme's recombinant human hyaluronidase, which allows the drug to be delivered under the skin rather than being infused intravenously. The problem wasn't with Baxter's Immune Globulin, but with Halozyme's technology. Some patients in the clinical trial developed non-neutralizing antibodies generated against recombinant human hyaluronidase. Although there weren't any adverse events associated with the formation of the antibodies, the FDA was concerned about their potential effects on reproduction, development, and fertility. Both Halozyme and Baxter will have to use pre-clinical data to convince the FDA that HyQ doesn't pose any undue risk.</p><p>With hope that the worst of the news was behind them and that the selloff was overdone, Halozyme stock has rebounded 60% from its lows in the last three trading sessions to a high of $6.13 before pulling back slightly. Halozyme appears to be an example of how one piece of news, whether positive or negative, can affect a nano, micro, or small cap biotechnology company. HyQ is just one drug in Halozyme's pipeline. The company is also partnered with Roche Holdings (<a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ROG%3aVX"">ROG</a>) and Interxon Corporation on other drugs as well as developing its own product. With other products in its pipeline and HyQ's fate still unknown, it should be interesting to see if Halozyme can continue to rebound from its fall.</p><p>Investing in any company that has little or no earnings can be like a stroll through a field of investment landmines. However, tremendous profits can be attained investing in one of the nano, micro or small cap biotechnology companies that appear to have a great upside on future developments. As the examples above show, the biotech sector is laden with a number of small research and development companies that appear to be on the edge of breaking out and becoming the next big winner, only to be batted down by less than exorbitant news - be it that the FDA did not approve their latest trial, the chatter of a buyout never materialized, or the high SG&amp;A expenses came into question. This is just a small sample of companies with great potential in the short term or longer term. There are many others with comparable potential that are trading at varied levels. Potential investors should ascertain their risk tolerance and perform their own risk/reward analysis to determine if either of these, or another in the sector, merits their investment of money, time and stress in the coming days, weeks, months and years ahead.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[BAX]], [[ADMD.OB]].</p>"
"1837332","2013-11-13 15:31:05","Treating Melanoma: Only The Best Shall Survive","<p><em>(Editors' Note: This article covers a micro-cap stock. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.)</em></p><p>Yesterday, I <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1833142-combination-therapies-hold-key-to-future-cancer-treatments"">wrote an article</a> showcasing how combination therapies involving anti-PD-1s stand ready to control the future of treating cancer. Most analysts believe that anti-PD-1s will be used to treat a slew of cancers, but as of now, the most robust data is seen in treating late-stage melanoma. With that said, following my anti-PD-1 combination article, I received an email from a reader who said, &quot;<i>I realize that anti-PD1s are great drugs, but doesn't it seem like developing a melanoma drug is a bad idea at this time?&quot;</i> He added, &quot;<i>Melanoma is very crowded, so why should I invest in any company with a melanoma drug</i>?&quot;</p><p>This anonymous reader makes a good point, one that has been discussed at times, but never in a great amount of detail. Therefore, let's look at melanoma as a disease, why it is such a hot space, and how investors should view what looks like a highly competitive and crowded area of treatment.</p><p><b>The Melanoma Development Rush</b></p><p>Since the 1970s, melanoma has more than <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/melanoma"">tripled</a> in incidence, and is currently growing at a rate of 10% annually. In particular, it is a patient population between the ages of 18 and 35 who are seeing such rapid growth. Therefore, because of both the problem and its growth, biotechnology and large pharmas have invested hundreds of millions into research, in an attempt to develop the next novel melanoma treatment. Moreover, data continues to get better each year.</p><p>The market for melanoma drugs has investors very excited, and much stems from the commercial success of melanoma drugs such Yervoy and Zelboraf. It is expected that just over 75,000 people will be newly diagnosed this year. The patient population is large in size, but with so many companies developing in the space, melanoma is quickly becoming crowded.</p><p>The issue of the developmental melanoma space crowding is not one that many discuss. Due to recent data, melanoma products have mostly sparked optimism; but in reality, it might be because the disease is one of the first cancers that technology is allowing us to &quot;nearly&quot; cure. Consequently, we are now encountering a problem with too many companies putting their hands in the cookie jar, with only a limited number of cookies. Thus, we could see products that never realize &quot;peak sales potential&quot;, or at least in certain patient populations. To better explain, I have created a chart below showing both approved treatments and those furthest in clinical development, which breaks melanoma down into stage and available treatment. Looking ahead, it will be competition in each &quot;Stage&quot; that ultimately allows blockbuster revenue or yields a commercial dud, thus creating shareholder gains or losses.</p><div class=""big_table""><div class=""zoom_table""> </div><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0""><tr><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Stage 1</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Stage II</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Stage III A</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Stage III B</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Stage III C</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Stage IV M1A</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Stage IV M1B</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Stage IV M1C</p></td></tr> <tr><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Surgery</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Surgery</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Surgery</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Surgery</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td></tr> <tr><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Radiation</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Radiation</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td></tr> <tr><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Nivolumab</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Nivolumab</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Nivolumab</p></td></tr> <tr><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Lambro</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Lambro</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Lambro</p></td></tr> <tr><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Yervoy</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Yervoy</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Yervoy</p></td></tr> <tr><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Zelboraf</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Zelboraf</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Zelboraf</p></td></tr> <tr><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Chemo</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>Chemo</p></td></tr> <tr><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>T-Vec</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>T-Vec</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>T-Vec</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td></tr> <tr><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>ImmunoPulse</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""><p>ImmunoPulse</p></td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td><td width=""97"" valign=""top""> </td></tr></table></div><p><b>Quite a Crowd for Stage IV</b></p><p>Right away, there are three stages that should catch your eye: Stages IV MIA, MIB, and MIC. Obviously, patients in these categories are the most difficult to treat, who currently have Yervoy or Zelboraf as treatment options. However, in the next couple of years, patients might have five options in each category, meaning that companies will have to share available dollars.</p><p>Yervoy is marketed by <b>Bristol-Myers</b> (BMY), and the drug has been a spark of excitement for the company. In Bristol's <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/7932092-bristol-myers-squibb-reports-third-quarter-2013-financial-results"">last quarter</a>, Yervoy saw growth of 33% year-over-year, producing sales of $238 million. In fact, Yervoy is given to about 50% of the Stage IV patient population, and has been popular because of its 11% overall response rate, a result that patients and physicians find preferable to chemo or death.</p><p>Zelboraf is marketed by Roche (RHHVY) and is given to patients who have a BRAF mutation. Therefore, its patient population is smaller, as the drug <a href=""http://www.kantarhealth.com/docs/default-source/press-articles/gsk-prices-tafinlar-at-7600-month-undercutting-roches-zelboraf.pdf?sfvrsn=4"">created sales</a> of just $245 million in 2012. As a result, Yervoy is currently targeting the bulk of this patient population, and its explosive growth can be tied to a lack of competition at this time.</p><p>With that said, nivolumab is also being developed by Bristol-Myers for late-stage melanoma and had an objective response nearly three times greater than Yervoy. Nivolumab is Bristol-Myers' anti-PD-1 drug, which was a big deal at this year's ASCO. Hence, suggesting that Bristol-Myers has both Yervoy and nivolumab, and is testing both in combination, investors are confident with the company's place atop the melanoma treatment space. But should they be so confident?</p><p>While this thought process has pushed shares 60% higher over the last year, Bristol-Myers also faces intense competition. Merck's (MRK) anti-PD-1, lambrolizumab, had a higher objective response (38%) and complete response in both the average and peak dose in its clinical trial compared to Bristol's drug. Moreover, Merck is also testing lambro as a combination treatment.</p><p>Since Bristol-Myers already has a large melanoma ecosystem in place, Merck will not completely eliminate Yervoy as a treatment, but lambro will steal dollars from Bristol-Myers. Then, as we look further down the road, Roche also has an anti-PD-1 to treat melanoma, which is not listed. It too will compete with both Bristol and Merck in this space. Thus, the multi-billion dollars in peak sales potential for these three programs may never actually materialize, except for the best in class.</p><p>Overall, in treating Stage IV melanoma, Bristol-Myers has the most to lose. It already has a blockbuster product on the market, and its best pipeline product faces competition from an even better pipeline product from Merck. Roche looks to be an under-the-radar player, already having Zelboraf and developing an anti-PD-1 that will likely see some success. Yet, I'm placing my bets on Merck, believing it could be the company with the most to gain, having the best product right now, and the best chance to reach billion-dollar potential.</p><p><b>What about Stage III?</b></p><p>As of now, treating Stage III cancer is not nearly as crowded. Currently, surgery and radiation are the only options available; yet both are too invasive and often create more health harm than good. Therefore, meet the two leading products in development: T-Vec from <b>Amgen</b> (AMGN) and ImmunoPulse from <b>OncoSec</b> (ONCS).</p><p>T-Vec is the first virus-based vaccine to show a clinical benefit at treating cancer. It creates an immune response by replicating until causing cancer cells to rupture. In Stage III testing it <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/business/melanoma-drug-succeeds-in-late-stage-trial.html?_r=1&amp;"">produced</a> a survival rate of 16% and an objective response of 18%. Clearly, T-Vec's data is better than that of Yervoy, but at the same time it's also being tested on a less aggressive patient population.</p><p>Nonetheless, Amgen's data has many believing that T-Vec could temporarily own Stage IV M1A and Stage III. Hence, T-Vec could produce blockbuster sales very quickly; it does not have to share the market with any other FDA approved treatment. Then, when you incorporate Amgen's recent acquisition of Onyx, it is clear the company is well on its way to being a major player in treating cancer. At 18 times earnings the stock is not cheap, but given its developments the company should see a multi-year growth period.</p><p>ImmunoPulse is a bit more speculative, having treated only 25 patients versus T-Vec's trial of more than 400 patients. Nonetheless, ImmunoPulse's objective response of 53% and complete response of 15% is noteworthy and must be considered as a potential threat to Amgen long-term. The reason to consider ImmunoPulse a threat to T-Vec is because of the amount of data OncoSec has produced regarding its technology.</p><p>The company uses electroporation, which is a method of creating electrical currents to increase the uptake of a drug by creating temporary pores in tumors. In testing melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma, OncoSec has proven this technology effective with no serious side effects. Also, <b>Inovio</b> (INO) uses the same exact technology with its synthetic vaccines, and in 2013 we've seen Inovio trade higher by 280% following data from several electroporation studies. Furthermore, OncoSec uses IL-12 with electroporation, which is a very potent drug.</p><p>Back in March, I <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1243661-a-comprehensive-look-at-immunotherapy-part-2"">interviewed an immunologist, Dr. Rahul Jasuja</a>, who mentioned IL-12, saying it is too toxic to be given systemically. Then, he gave a personal experience, saying:</p><blockquote><p><blockquote class=""quote""><p><i>&quot;When I was in academia I worked in a lab where I would collect blood samples from patients who had been given IL-12 systemically and the treatment would have modest efficacy, but was extremely harsh and toxic -it would make patients weak, tired, sick, and would create the worst flu-like symptoms. So the quality of life is lousy. Thus, the potential to deliver IL-12 locally has major implications if it shows efficacy and safety in current studies.&quot;</i></p></blockquote></p></blockquote><p>With that said, the purpose of electroporation is to increase the uptake of a drug which then decreases its side effects, as less of the agent is needed. OncoSec is trying to deliver an effective agent, and if it can diminish the side effects then there is reason to believe that ImmunoPulse will be a success. However, I don't know if ImmunoPulse will challenge or overtake T-Vec in treating Stage III cancer, but with data expected in the next couple months, it is worth following nonetheless, with the most to gain and not much to lose.</p><p><b>Final Thoughts</b></p><p>When it's all said and done, this is a crowded space where only a few will excel. Roche may be okay, but I think Merck is the clear winner with the best product in development for Stage IV. Consequently, Bristol-Myers has traded higher this last year in large part due to Yervoy's success and data from its anti-PD-1 program. Thus, I think it has the most to lose.</p><p>In treating Stage III, Amgen's T-Vec has a clear path to blockbuster sales, which combined with its other cancer products might make the company a compelling investment opportunity. However, given the early clinical results from OncoSec and its proven technology, I'd monitor the company's data, as I wouldn't be surprised one bit if ImmunoPulse eventually challenges or surpasses T-Vec in annual sales.</p><p>As a result, there are a lot of changes taking place in this space and even more when you consider companies such as NewLink Genetics are also developing in the space. With that said, I think the crowd of companies in melanoma tells us one thing: Data might be good and enough to move stocks, but investors must acknowledge and monitor potential competitors. When it's all said and done, competition is what will either allow or prevent companies from reaching full potential, because only the best drugs will survive.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

"713761","2012-07-11 05:34:59","Intellectual Property Of A Biotech: An Analysis","<p>For biotech investors, there is little as frustrating as digging through mounds of medical journals and browsing websites in an attempt to interpret clinical trial results, trial timelines and potential drug market values. Presented clinical data can be confusing, complicated, biased and even contradictory at times. Biotech companies often purposely delay both positive and negative data for their own purposes and may only report a portion of the data from their trials. Potential marketing value for a drug can also be elusive with differing patient targets for specific indications with phrases often seen such as &quot;for breast cancer patients with overexpression of HER2 +2 or +3&quot; or other such jargon that not only makes researching the marketing potential difficult, but it also makes it difficult to perform &quot;apples to apples&quot; comparisons among similar drugs.</p><p>The deeper a biotech investor digs for data and marketing potential the more questions than answers can often be found. Some of the most difficult research an investor can undertake is in a biotech's patent portfolio protecting its valuable intellectual property. This property not only increases the market value of the company owning it, but it also protects the drugs' future marketability as it can reduce or prevent competitive products from draining sales from the drug's future and prevent &quot;copycat&quot; drugs from finding loopholes and directly competing with the company. The money and years invested in any drug truly drains a biotech's finances. In order to survive, they must start marketing or licensing their final product at some point in order to survive. When/if &quot;The FDA Approves Drug XYZ&quot; for the biotech is finally announced, the company must be confident in its product's return on investment or the millions of dollars and years of research could be in vain for the company. An analysis of the varied patents a biotech company possesses is necessary for those wishing to predict the company's expected profitability in the event its product is ultimately cleared for marketing.</p><p>ImmunoCellular Therapeutics (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/imuc"">IMUC</a>) is a development phase biotech with a phase II trial for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme ((GBM)) expected to complete enrollment sometime in Q2 2012. Interim data analysis is expected in Q4 2012 or Q1 2013, and the company as well as investors are hopeful with the trial garnering much attention as evident from the common stock's price run up from January 10th's $1.05 to the current price hovering around $3.50 per share. The company's press releases have been largely focused on the phase I trial results for ICT-107 for the above-mentioned GBM and the follow up phase II trial. The data is indeed impressive, even for a small patient set. However, investors should also be taking note of the additional press releases as pertaining to patent protections applied for as well as those awarded. The July 10th <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/immunocellular-therapeutics-brain-cancer-technology-receives-important-japanese-patent-allowance-2012-07-10"">announcement</a> of the Japanese patent allowance for IMUC's multi-antigen approach to fighting brain cancer is a sure sign that the company is taking its intellectual property protection very seriously. It is this patent protection that will protect the value of the company's pipeline and will also attract Big Pharma suitors for M&amp;A and licensing purposes. To aid current and potential investors in their intellectual property research for ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, an overview of their patent portfolio as granted and applied for is presented below and pertains directly to their current clinical and pre-clinical work. As you read through these patents, remember many are here to protect the company's worldwide license in some of these cases, greatly multiplying the potential financial benefit that will could evident for licensing and marketing purposes.</p><p><strong>Granted Patents</strong></p><p><strong>US 8097256</strong></p><p>US 8,097,256 is titled &quot;Cancer Vaccines and Vaccination Methods&quot; with patent allowance <a href=""http://www.imuc.com/imuc-10-10-2011"">announced</a> on October 10th, 2011. This is a key patent for ImmunoCellular as it is critical in protecting the company's lead product, ICT-107. The invention is for a cancer vaccine and is designed to claim the epitopes (part of the antigens the T-cells, B-cells or antibodies recognize) for any combination of 4, 5 or 6 of the following antigens: tyrosinase-related protein ((TRP))-2, Melanoma-associated Antigen-1 (MAGE-1), HER-2, IL-13 receptor &alpha;2, gp100, and AIM-2. This patent is specific to claim the invention as a vaccine for gliomas, glioblastoma multiforme ((GBM)) and astrocytomas. To cover claims for off-the-shelf and patient specific vaccines, the patent coverage is for allogeneic and autologous (the latter like Dendreon's Provenge or Immunotherapy's ICT-107) prepared vaccines. The allogeneic claim will be helpful for future products as vaccines prepared via this approach would be cheaper and much quicker to prepare and would be more readily available for patients needing treatment immediately upon diagnosis or immediately after a front-line treatment. The dendritic cells created in the process are key to immunotherapy (here vaccines) as they are antigen presenters and are what the patient's immunity system is seeking out to have an immune response against. The invention here is not only for the typical epitope but also superagonist epitopes that the dendritic cells present to the immunity system. Superagonist epitopes are modified epitopes that have amino acid substitutions at the function group sites making them generate a more potent immune response than the naturally occurring epitopes. It appears that the keys to this patent are two-fold. First, the vaccine will stimulate an immune response against a wide range of brain cancers with any of the 6 antigens over expressed. A patient with any one of these or multiples of these is a viable candidate. Secondly, the tumors may evolve to present different types of antigens than the one determined in initial testing. A drug targeting only one type of antigen would be ineffective if the tumor evolved to have a different expression. In this case, 6 different antigens are targeted and a mutated version within these 6 antigens would also be targeted.</p><p><strong>US 7939090</strong></p><p>US 7,939,090 is titled &quot;System and Method for the Treatment of Cancer, Including Cancers of the Central Nervous System&quot;. The company <a href=""http://www.imuc.com/imuc-06-21-2011"">announced</a> its allowance on June 21, 2011 noting that the patent covers the combination of a dendritic cell based vaccine combined concurrently with or before chemotherapy is administered at the recurrence of the disease ((GBM)). Like most cancer vaccines, it is typically not administered as a first line treatment to attack cancer alone but rather is used to prevent recurrence after a front line treatment of resection, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The patent specifically claims the combination of the vaccine with at least one or a combination of the following chemotherapy agents: temozolomide, procarbazine, vincristine, BCNU, CCNU, thalidomide, irinotecan, isotretinoin, imatinib and/or etoposide. The invention summary states &quot;The dual therapeutic approach of the instant invention may further be implemented to beneficially influence the chemosensitivity of a mammal with cancer, including cancers of the CNS, by vaccinating the mammal with DC prior to and/or concurrently with administration of chemotherapy.&quot; This response is well documented with a host of accompanying drawings in the patent application. However, not noted in this patent is the fact that chemotherapy often weakens the immunity system and also somewhat mutes the immune response. Therefore, it appears the best time to administer the vaccine is indeed before or with the chemotherapy agents when the immunity system is still at its strongest. An additional statement in the patent award is also key as it is a very broad and general coverage for the patent stating, &quot;The cancer vaccine used in various embodiments of the instant invention may be selected from any dendritic cell (DC)- based cancer vaccine, and can be administered by routine methods.&quot; Essentially, this patent appears to protect any DC-based drug the company develops or licenses in combination with the chemotherapy agents mentioned in the award. This patent award is key and a great addition to ImmunoCellular's intellectual property.</p><p><strong>US 8129184</strong></p><p>US 8,129,184 is titled &quot;Cancer Stem Cell Antigen Vaccines and Methods&quot;. The company <a href=""http://www.imuc.com/imuc-02-01-2012"">announced</a> its allowance on February 1st of this year. It gives protection to the company's pipeline that includes cancer stem cell targeting as part of the treatment protocol. The patent covers various methods of combining dendritic cells with cancer stem cell (CSC) antigens, which teaches them to present the cancer stem cell antigens as targets for an immune response. Cancer stem cells are being implicated in the recurrent nature of many cancers. After cancer cells are killed via whatever first line method was used, CSC's often remain as they are more like &quot;normal&quot; human cells and do not reproduce very rapidly and are less susceptible to the agents that typically kill the faster growing and faster reproducing cancer cells. CSC's are capable of mutating and creating another generation of cancer cells often more resistant to the chemotherapy agents or irradiation that was used to destroy the first generation cancer cells. If CSC's can be targeted and destroyed, the recurrent nature of many cancers can be delayed or even prevented thereby helping to create a true cure for cancers. Inherent in the technology is a likely synergistic use of a CSC vaccine for many cancers, which are difficult to destroy because of their propensity to mutate. A potent initial first line treatment may prove to be enough to destroy a cancer in theory if the adaptive nature of the cancer is nullified via an adjuvant CSC targeted immune response. The patent covers not only concepts and administration of the vaccine, but also the methods of preparing the vaccine not only via a patient-specific autologous but also an off the shelf allogeneic approach. Antigens utilized via either approach for directly targeting the CSC's are identified in the patent as any combination of the following: CD133, CD90, CD44, CXCR4, Nestin, Musashi-1 (Msi1), maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK), GLI1, PTCH1, Bmi-1, phosphoserine phosphatase ((PSP)), Snail, OCT4, BCRP1, MGMT, Bcl-2, FLIP, BCL-XL, XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2, NAIP, or surviving. A mention was even made in the patent of a synthetic peptide as being presented in some embodiments.</p><p><strong>Patents Applied For</strong></p><p><strong>US 2010/0310643 A1</strong></p><p>US 2010/0310643 A1 is titled &quot;CD 133 Epitopes&quot;. The application was submitted May 7, 2010 and June 03, 2010 with the former as WO 2010/028066 A3R4 as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_application"">provisional</a>. The application claims use of the antigen CD133 and many of its amino acid variants to be utilized as a means of targeting cancer cells via an immunotherapy approach. Specifically, it claims &quot;A method for treating a cancer in a patient, the method comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising antigen-presenting cells, wherein the antigen presenting cells present on their surface a peptide epitope comprising the amino sequence ILSAFSVYV (SEQ ID NO:1) with four or fewer amino acid substitutions&quot;. As mentioned in patent 8,129,184 above, CD133 is an antigen targeted for CSC immune response. The company recently <a href=""http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120327005600/en/ImmunoCellular-Therapeutics-Present-Cancer-Stem-Cell-Targeting"">presented data</a> at the AACR annual meeting indicating in vitro human cell studies and in vivo studies in mice indicating a safe profile and immunogenicity of two peptides as a potential vaccine to target CD133 CSCs. They indicated plans in using this technology as the basis for ICT-121 for recurrent glioblastoma for its initial indication with clinicals for additional solid tumors to follow. The latter comes as no surprise as CD133 cells are highly enriched in CSC's in colon cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer, myeloma and melanoma. Like ImmunoCellular's approved patents, this one would cover all aspects of isolation, preparation and administration of the vaccine and its active and modified dendritic (antigen presenting) cells. As ICT-121 trials get underway, this patent's approval will become key if clinicals are favorable not only for its current recurrent GBM indication, but also other indications' possibilities.</p><p><strong>US2002/0182219 A1</strong></p><p>US2002/0182219 A1 is titled &quot;Cancer Immunotherapy&quot; and was submitted on March 22 and published December of 2002. The patent has yet to be approved, and there have been no recent updates on the application. Although an older application, it is a novel attempt at what could be the future of the war on cancer, a cancer preventative vaccine. Most cancer vaccines in clinicals now are attempts at first line treatment or as an adjuvant for prevention of cancer recurrence. This application is for a vaccine that stimulates an immune response against cells expressing IL-13R&alpha;2 in patients having or at risk for developing a disease having cells expressing IL-13R&alpha;2. Not going into a lengthy discussion on this patent because of its age, the application of the patent could be substantial if/when it is approved. The very nature of using IL-13R&alpha;2 is intriguing as it has potential advantages over other discussed antigens. It is a cell-surface receptor which gives it much exposure in the immune system, especially important in a difficult area such as gliomas in which the blood/brain barrier is difficult to overcome. It is also expressed on a wide range of high-grade gliomas and the testes (which are immune privileged which reduces the chance of a hopeful immune response turning into an autoimmune nightmare by attacking unintended targets/organs). IL-13R&alpha;2 is a great target for anti-cancer immunotherapy because of its size (380 amino acids in IL-13R&alpha;2 and 343 amino acids in the extracellular domain), which gives an immune response multiple epitopes to recognize and target.</p><p>These three granted and two requested patents are key to ImmunoCellular's marketability as a suitor, to their future profitability via technology licensing and/or to their future profitability as a pharmaceutical with their own products to push through trials, gain marketing approval for and then produce/market on their own. As clinicals progress and the true value of the company's product line is realized, these patents will become more valuable. The wording in these patents is important as loop holes are closed and the applicability of the technology for several indications will only increase their value and ImmunoCellular Therapeutics' price tag for Big Pharma and individual investors as 2012 progresses.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.</p>"

Any discouraging news from across the pond also doesn't serve well in the US markets.</p><p>The jobs report issued last Friday failed to inspire confidence in many media outlets, given that the number of jobs added in March fell short of expectations.

Galderma's specialty is dermatology and has a reputation as a global leader in the field.</p><p>Galderma also has a strong relationship with Nuvo Research, from whom the company licensed worldwide marketing rights for Pliaglis, a topical local anesthetic cream that has already been approved by the FDA for use in &quot;superficial dermatological procedures.&quot;</p><p>Due to some manufacturing issues with Galderma's third-party contractor, the already-approved Pliaglis was voluntarily removed from the U.S. market in 2008. Those issues have since been solved and the product is again before the FDA for approval, with a decision expected on April 16. Sentiment has it that the upcoming approval will be a no-brainer, since it was already approved once, and if that turns out to be the case, then Galderma plans to launch the marketing and sale of Pliaglis in the U.S. in the second half of 2012.</p><p>Approval and launches in the European Union are also expected to take place during the second half of the year.</p><p>Given the upcoming FDA catalyst, the NRIFF share price has been on the move over the past few months, more than doubling since early in the year.

"1006281","2012-11-14 08:13:23","The Stem Cell Sector Further Validates Itself With A Successful Q3","<p>It is the ongoing aspiration of virtually every small pharma or biotech investor to find an overlooked but promising small capitalization company and secure a wise entry position well before the masses are interested. The small pharmaceutical sector is one of the best for finding these promising companies with potential gains of many multiples beyond their current valuations. There are good and bad apples in the barrel with some being more obvious than others. When performing initial research into the many divisions of the small pharma sector, investors soon begin to realize that there are many possibilities with promising and scary outcomes depending on the choices made. With new drugs and medical devices being developed by these small cap companies with valuations from only $1 million to over $500 million, the choices are seemingly endless with varying levels of legitimacy, product development and targeted market sizes. Even with the publicly available information that investors can locate for researching the choices, they often lack enough information to garner a confident investment decision.</p><p>I wish to present to investors a small sector within the small pharmaceuticals with huge upside potential due to the unmet needs targeted and due to the early stage development of the sector as a whole - the stem cell companies. Stem cells are early stage undifferentiated cells capable of becoming any type of tissue in the human body depending on how it is coerced to develop. The cells can theoretically be utilized to regenerate damaged or missing tissue to help treat Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord and other types of injuries, stroke, burns, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis and even rheumatoid arthritis. The possibilities are endless with huge unmet needs being targeted and large marketing potential for the successfully developed and marketed therapies. The sector is still predominantly in early stages of development with very few regulatory approvals to its credit. However, I believe this to be a sector of huge potential for those seeking early entry into credible and overlooked companies. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta has even expressed his opinions on his <a href=""http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2012/11/06/stem-cells-vs-heart-attacks/"">blog</a> about the growth and new hope in stem cell therapies. Showing his level of hope for the therapy, especially in repair of heart tissue after a heart attack, he <span>stated, </span>&quot;But now, there is growing optimism that stem cell therapy may help patients with damaged hearts return to a fully functional life, based on results from early studies.&quot; I strongly recommend investors with a growing interest in the stem cell sector to read through the remainder of his comments as he and an interviewee provide <span>for </span>good insight into where the sector is likely heading, at least for cardiovascular treatment.</p><p>Once investors begin their own research into the possibilities, it becomes fairly evident which ones are progressing and which ones are mired in technological and financial difficulties. With a limited number of companies construed as true stem cell companies, I aim to present what I believe to be the most promising of the sector with potential for solid gains. As the companies develop and mature, they will likely validate themselves and the sector, as a <span>whole, </span>will likely attract additional investor attention and money. The ones presented below have had recent success with an exciting and promising few months behind it, more specifically in Q3 2012. The list should be construed as a good starting point for interested investors. With a smaller number of representatives than many, the sector is just beginning to enter the next stage of development with development-phase companies beginning to progress into marketing-phase entities.</p><p><strong>Osiris Therapeutics (OSIR)</strong> leads off the list of presented companies as it has the first and only approved stem cell therapy by an internationally recognized regulatory authority. <a href=""http://investor.osiris.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=674658"">On May 17th</a> the company announced it had received Canadian approval for its lead product candidate, Prochymal. Osiris received marketing approval for Prochymal to treat GvHD - a complication of bone marrow transplantation that is lethal for 80 percent of children affected, often within weeks of the diagnosis. <a href=""http://investor.osiris.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=683073"">On June 14th</a> Osiris received another approval for Prochymal to treat GvHD, this time in New Zealand, further validating its potential.</p><p>Leading off Q3, <span>the </span>company continued to impress with promising phase 2 results announced on <a href=""http://investor.osiris.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=688302"">July 2nd</a> for Prochymal to treat patients experiencing first-time acute myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack. The trial enrolled 220 patients who were given single infusions of either Prochymal or a placebo intravenously within a week of suffering a heart attack. Patients receiving Prochymal had significantly less cardiac hypertrophy relative to patients receiving placebo (p &lt; 0.05) and also experienced significantly less stress-induced ventricular arrhythmia (p &lt; 0.05). The press release defined the criteria <span>stating</span>, &quot;Cardiac hypertrophy and ventricular arrhythmia are indicators of pathological remodeling following heart injury and provide insight into the mechanism by which mesenchymal stem cells attenuate heart injury following a myocardial infarction.&quot; To put the effectiveness of the therapy into perspective, typically a (p &le; 0.05) indicates statistical significance noting that the positive outcome was a result of the therapy and not due to chance. Further evaluation of the clinical data indicated that seven patients who were treated with the placebo eventually had additional heart failure requiring treatment with intravenous diuretics, compared to none of the Prochymal patients for a (p=0.01) significance. Patients receiving placebo also required re-hospitalization for cardiac issues sooner than the patients receiving Prochymal to the tune of a median of 27.5 days versus 85.5 days, respectively.</p><p>Osiris reported <a href=""http://investor.osiris.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=718503"">Q3 results</a> on November 5th. As of September 30th, the company had cash and equivalents of $39.4 million. It reported revenue of $2.2 million as a result of a 6-fold increase in its Biosurgery products from the same period in 2011. Net cash used for operations in the quarter was $1.6 million with an additional $3 million used for research and development. No mention of the current production or marketing of Prochymal was made in the press release which are probably still in the early stages of implementation. Investment potential in Osiris is promising relative to the rest of the sector obviously due to the upcoming marketing of Prochymal. Although the GvHD indication is small, it will still generate some revenue to help defray the costs associated with the development of the rest of its pipeline. The phase 2 success of Prochymal for heart attack patients is evidence for the possible use of the therapy for yet another targeted group along with the possibilities of many others. With the rest of the sector in purely development mode, Osiris will soon be marketing the first approved stem cell therapy in the world. This helps to validate not only the company's approach and pipeline, but also the technology for the sector as a whole.</p><p><strong>Aastrom Biosciences (ASTM)</strong> had a fairly quiet Q3 but makes the list as a result of late Q2 preclinical results and due to its current low share price hovering just above its 52-week low. The company's current focus is on using its stem cell platform to target patients with the vascular and heart diseases critical limb <span>ischemia </span>((CLI)) and <span>dilated </span>cardiomyopathy ((DCM)). Aastrom announced in June the results of a <a href=""http://investors.aastrom.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=680999"">preclinical study</a> in animals of its patient-specific ixmyelocel-T cell therapy to treat DCM. The study gave promising results indicating that ixmyelocel-T helped to protect ischemic hearts from damage in an animal model of heart failure. The general conclusion was that &quot;animals treated with ixmyelocel-T demonstrated a reduced mortality compared to control (22% versus 44%, respectively) and decreased infarct size and increased survival when compared to a vehicle control group.&quot;</p><p>Ixmyelocel-T is also Aastrom's lead product candidate, but for another indication. Now in an early <a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01483898?term=Aastrom%26rank=9"">phase 3 trial</a>, termed the REVIVE trial, it is being evaluated for its potential to treat patients with CLI with no options for revascularization. Enrollment began in February with final data collected in early 2015. The trial's primary endpoint is amputation free survival (AFS) at 12 months with secondary evaluations for percent of patients with adverse events, percent of patients with wound closure by 12 months, and percent of patients experiencing major cardiovascular events (MACE) by 6, 12 and 18 months.</p><p>Aastrom presented Q3 results on <a href=""http://investors.aastrom.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=719906"">November 8th</a>. The press release made a brief mention of the REVIVE trial stating that it &quot;accelerated patient enrollment and continued to increase the number of clinical investigators and sites in the Phase 3 REVIVE-CLI clinical study of ixmyelocel-T in patients with critical limb ischemia.&quot; <span></p><p><span>The </span>company's financials remain marginal, like most development phase biotechs, with the company having $21.1 million in cash and equivalents as of September 30th. With the REVIVE trial fully underway throughout Q3; the cash burn rate has become more evident. For the quarter, Aastrom used $6.1 million for research and development and $2.1 million for general and administrative expenses. A $40 million offering earlier in the year helped to shore up the company's financials for the interim. Now trading just above its 52-week low, promising developments in the near future could make this an opportune time for a long position. However, investors should consider the risks and watch the share price closely as a close below the current 52-week low is a bearish sign.

(NBS)</strong> investors have had a wild ride in 2012 with a 52-week stock range of $0.30 to $0.90. The company is a multi-faceted cell therapy company with clinicals underway through its stem cell therapy, AMR-001, by its Amorcyte division and increasing revenue generation from its contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO), Progenitor Cell Therapy (PCT) division. PCT manufactures not only stem cell therapies for other companies, but also other types of cell therapies such as those for immunotherapy biotechs. Like Osiris, NeoStem started out Q3 with exciting news that also separates itself from much of the remainder of the sector. On <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/news/neostem-subsidiary-progenitor-cell-therapy-and-sotio-enter-into-a-phase-3-manufacturing-services-agreement.html"">July 16th</a> the company announced yet another manufacturing services agreement, but this time it would be for an advanced clinical in the form of a pivotal phase 3 trial with SOTIO, LLC, presumably for its dendritic cell prostate cancer vaccine. With multiple high-profile companies putting their trust and money in PCT's capabilities, the revenue generating capability of the division continues to grow and offset costs associated with its own clinical trials now underway. Recent new clients include an agreement with <a href=""http://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/25539/neostems-pct-unit-named-manufacturer-in-baxter-phase-iii-stem-cell-trial-25539.html"">Baxter International</a> (BAX) to produce a phase 3 CD34+ stem cell therapy to target chronic myocardial ischemia and an expanded partnership with <a href=""http://www.imuc.com/imuc-04-04-2012"">ImmunoCellular Therapeutics</a> (IMUC) to produce the company's lead product candidate, ICT-107, for its phase 2 trial to treat the brain cancer, glioblastoma multiforme.</p><p>A credit to PCT's expertise and competency are the capabilities of two of the companies with which it now has manufacturing agreements. <a href=""http://www.sotio.com/about-us/the-company"">SOTIO</a> already has cell therapy manufacturing capabilities at its disposal through its Prague facility, described by the company as among the largest in Europe. Baxter also has an impressive manufacturing entity through its Biopharma Solutions CMO unit. On April 11th, Baxter's Biopharma Solutions CMO unit was named &quot;<a href=""http://www.baxter.com/press_room/features/2012/vie_award.html"">Best Contract Manufacturing Organization</a>&quot; for the third consecutive year at the annual Vaccine Industry Excellence (VIE) Awards at the World Vaccine Congress in Washington, D.C. This recognition of Baxter's capabilities also gives additional creditability to NeoStem's PCT division due to the obvious trust Baxter places in the company for its critical phase 3 candidate.</p><p>Not to be overshadowed by NeoStem's PCT division, Amorcyte stepped up to the plate on <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/news/neostem-reports-data-safety-monitoring-board-recommends-continuation-of-preserve-ami-phase-2-trial-neostem-reports-data-safety-monitoring-board-recommends-continuation-of-preserve-ami-phase-2-trial.html"">August 15th</a> with a press release noting that the data monitoring committee recommended continuation of its phase 2 trial of its lead product candidate stem cell therapy, AMR-001, to prevent major adverse cardiac events following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Enrollment in the trial initiated in January with enrollment completion expected in 2013 with 6-month data readout in 2H 2013. NeoStem intends to initiate a phase 1 trial of AMR-001 to treat patients with congestive heart failure, a target patient population four times that of the AMI indication, in early 2013. These events and others should continue to garner additional attention for the company next year and beyond as interim and final data come to light and the therapy possibly keeps validating its therapeutic potential.</p><p>NeoStem's investment potential is in its capability to set itself apart from much of the remainder of the sector through its PCT CMO division. With promising clinicals underway, the revenue generated from PCT will help to offset the development costs of AMR-001, a capability that most of the remainder of the stem cell sector does not have. Growth in the division will likely only continue as success and validation of stem cell therapies and immunotherapy vaccines will help to keep those two sectors growing and needing reliable sources of cell therapy products. With <a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/e/121113/nbs10-q.html"">Q3 results</a> released November 13th; interested investors should begin performing their own research into the company's possibilities. With regard to the PCT division, potential investors should note the comments on the PCT CMO in the 10Q, &quot;Clinical Services, representing process development and clinical manufacturing services provided at PCT to its various clients, were approximately $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012 compared to $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011, representing an increase of approximately $1.9 million or 188%. The increase in clinical services revenue is due to an increased overall visibility of PCT and penetration into the cell therapy marketplace along with a general increase in the development of autologous cell therapies in the United States due to enhanced investment and expanded marketing programs in 2011 and 2012.&quot; Interested investors should review the quarterly statements since NeoStem acquired PCT in <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/news/neostem-acquires-progenitor-cell-therapy.html"">January 2011</a> and evaluate the growth in the CMO division in order to confirm growth as well as the sustainability of the growth.</p><p>NeoStem is still operating at a loss, but its revenue growth should inevitably conquer the costs if the current growth rate continues. The CMO revenue is substantial as it sets the company apart from much of the rest of the sector with solid earnings. It also helps to protect against downside in the event that regulatory or safety concerns slows the stem cell sector growth as it also serves the cancer immunotherapy (vaccine) sector, thereby giving it some added diversity.</p><p><strong>Neuralstem, Inc. (CUR)</strong> was fairly quiet during most of the quarter but did have its day in the spotlight midway through. On <a href=""http://investor.neuralstem.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=203908%26p=irol-newsArticle%26ID=1734926%26highlight="">September 13th</a> the company announced publication of a study using its stem cells to treat surgically paralyzed rats. In the study, the rats' spinal cords were severed and then subsequently injected with Neuralstem's NSI-566 spinal cord stem cells. According to the publication, the paralyzed rats &quot;recovered significant locomotors function, regaining movement in all lower extremity joints, and that the transplanted neural stem cells turned into neurons which grew a &quot;remarkable&quot; number of axons that extended for &quot;very long distances&quot; over 17 spinal segments, making connections both above and below the point of severance. These axons reached up to the cervical region (C4) and down to the lumbar region (L1). They also appeared to make reciprocal synaptic connectivity with the host rat spinal cord neurons in the gray matter for several segments below the injury.&quot;</p><p>Although an early-stage study and only evaluated in animal models, the news catapulted Neuralstem's shares by more than 90% above its previous day's close with a closing price still up over 38% on the day. The euphoria over the possibilities the results could represent in future advanced clinical trials is an indicator, in my opinion, of the possible investment potential in the future for many of the sector's companies as their clinicals advance and marketing potential is more fully realized. However, as I explained in an <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/877191-neuralstem-reminds-investors-of-stem-cell-rewards-and-risk"">earlier article</a>, Neuralstem and most of the rest of the true stem cell companies are still development-phase entities. As such it still relies on investor capital for its funding, which somewhat limits upside potential in the interim due to stock offerings and other sources of financing. Neuralstem's recent offering should minimize the need for additional funding for the midterm. Its growing product line and investor interest due to the regeneration of the rats' spinal cords will likely keep it on investor watch lists for years to come.</p><p>Due to the development-phase status of the stem cell sector, I believe Osiris and NeoStem offer unique possibilities for differing reasons with revenue generation already underway, although neither is operating in the black as of yet. Aastrom's high profile phase 3 REVIVE trial interim data will likely be presented in 2013 and could be a huge share price mover if results are promising. Neuralstem's excitement could very well continue into 2013 with its own company updates, and the looming possibility of clinical trials for its NSI-566 spinal cord stem cells in human patients. Each of the companies presented, along with others in the growing sector, present differing levels of risk and potential reward depending on the companies' development status, pipeline progression, financial condition and targeted patient groups. Interested investors should perform in-depth research and consider the possibilities of both upside and downside potential. 2012 has been an exciting and breakthrough year for the stem cell sector. The growth and excitement for the sector and its hopes will likely continue, as will investor and analyst interest. Although the sector as a whole will likely benefit from the increasing interest, the companies presented above may very well lead the sector with possible gains for those taking wise and educated entries. For added comparisons on valuation (as of market close November 17th) versus revenue and development status, please see the chart below.

"1054691","2012-12-10 09:36:23","Companies Advancing Radiotherapy In Fighting Cancer May Also Deliver Strong Gains For Investors","<p><a href=""http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/about-cancer/treatment/radiotherapy/about/what-radiotherapy-is"">Radiotherapy</a> has been used to fight cancers for over 100 years. There are basically two means to administer radiation: external radiotherapy and internal radiotherapy (also known as <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/brachytherapy/MY00323"">brachytherapy</a>.) With internal radiotherapy a radiation source is administered with precise placement inside or next to the site of the cancerous tumor. It is commonly used as an effective treatment for prostate, breast, cervical, and head and neck cancer, as well as others. The radioactive material, or seeds, inserted in the body cavity are generally delivered via a catheter allowing for a higher dose of radiation to a more specific part of the body. It differs from <a href=""http://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-Brachytherapy.aspx2Ed%20Alternative%20Type%20of%20Brachytherapy%20Proves%20Effective%20in%20Mice.docx"">conventional radiation</a> therapy, which uses an external beam, that projects radiation from outside of the body; thus brachytherapy has shown to cause fewer side effects and requires a shorter treatment time than conventional radiation. However, there are limitations to conventional brachytherapy, the most prominent being the need to surgically implant and remove the seeds (in some cases). But brachytherapy is also advancing in its delivery systems, and new methods are being tested to develop the next generation of this type of radiotherapy.</p><p>A new method tested at Duke University uses an alternative brachytherapy approach by injecting the seed directly into the body instead of using a catheter to deliver the radioactive material. The doctors, using mice models, injected the tumors with a biodegradable elastin-like <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=658045"">polypeptide</a> ((ELP)) with <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=45855"">radioactive iodine</a>, which they found shrank the tumors, and in some cases eliminated the tumors completely. The researchers identified the ELP that had demonstrated the best tumor retention, and they tested three variations (in mouse models) of prostate and <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/head-and-neck"">head and neck cancers</a>. After only a single administration, the most effective variation shrank tumors in all of the mice regardless of tumor type. It also completely eliminated tumors in two-thirds of the mice with head and neck tumors, and all of the mice with prostate tumors. <a href=""http://www.aacr.org/home/public--media/aacr-press-releases.aspx?d=2963"">Dr. Wenge Liu</a>, associate research professor of biomedical engineering at Duke University, and lead investigator of the study explained, &quot;We set out to develop an alternative approach to brachytherapy that would eliminate the need for surgery.&quot; Dr. Liu continued, &quot;We believe that this approach provides a useful alternative to existing brachytherapy, which requires a complicated surgical procedure to implant the radioactive seeds. Moreover, these injectable seeds degrade after the radiation is exhausted, so they do not need to be surgically removed.&quot; Thus injectable treatments could eliminate some of the difficulties associated with brachytherapy, and in the future this injection method could be used as a treatment for a variety of cancers, replacing conventional brachytherapy.</p><p>Interestingly, a small isotope company from Kennewick, Washington<strong>, Advanced Medical Isotope Corporation (ADMD.OB)</strong>, has been touting its <a href=""http://www.medical-newswire.com/?prID=99859"">Radiogel</a> cancer treatment, an injectable therapy similar to the one discussed above, though using a different isotope. The therapy is a radiotherapy treatment where a water-based polymer containing yttrium-90 microspheres (Y-90), a medical isotope used to fight cancers, is injected directly into the tumor. Once injected, the body's own heat causes the liquid to turn into a gel forming a lattice around the Y-90 microspheres in the targeted area. The high-energy beta particles irradiate cancer cells in the target mass with little of the radiation affecting nearby healthy tissue. This maximizes the radiation dose at the tumor while minimizing exposure to nearby healthy tissues. Radiogel therapy can be delivered either during a surgical procedure or with an injection directly through the skin into the solid tumors and can be used when a cancer tumor cannot be surgically removed. ADMD acquired the license and numerous patents relating to Radiogel from Battelle, the world's largest independent research and development company. Radiogel technology could have a major impact on the future methods used to battle various cancers. The positive news from the research at Duke University could serve to validate Radiogel's use and additionally provide for more exposure for ADMD.</p><p>Interestingly, ADMD started as an isotope production company and is becoming one of the few companies producing medical isotopes in the USA. In May of 2010, the company entered into a <a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/e/120814/admd10-q.html"">licensing agreement</a> for the patent rights in the area of radioisotope production using electron beam accelerator(s) for creating short-lived radioisotopes such as Mo-99 and Tech-99 with the University of Missouri. ADMD is also producing short-lived and stable isotopes for Positron Emission Tomography ((PET)) procedures with a PULSAR Isotope Production system, the first compact <a href=""http://blog.qualitystocks.net/qualitystocks-partner-stockguru/stockguru-news-advanced-medical-isotope-corporation-installs-first-compact-linear-accelerator-for-isotope-production-in-north-america/"">linear accelerator</a> ((LINAC)) in North America designed for the production of medical isotopes used in PET imaging. Medical isotopes are big business; the <a href=""http://www.medicalisotopes.org/faq.html"">demand</a> is on the rise. In the USA, 18 million medical procedures use medical isotopes, and the demand is expected to rise <a href=""http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf55.html"">10% annually</a>. 90% of all the non-PET radioisotopes used in the United States are imported giving ADMD quite a future in isotope production and sales.</p><p>ADMD is an $18 million market cap company, selling for just under $0.25 per share, which could be considered a bargain basement price if either its Radiogel proves successful or its isotope line proves lucrative. Either way, ADMD now has two separate avenues to develop product raising its odds of becoming a successful company. I like ADMD, I see a lot of potential growth with both its medical isotope production and its move into the nuclear medicine with Radiogel, and if successful I wouldn't be surprised if a larger pharmaceutical company swoops in to buy up ADMD. Considered to be a speculative buy until the company begins to prove itself more, interested investors should consider all risks associated with this mostly development-phase company including its OTC status, its financials and its small $18 million market capitalization.</p><p>Injectable may or may not be the future in brachytherapy, but today's treatments still require surgical methods to implant the seeds, and <strong>Theragenics Corporation, (TGX)</strong> a micro-cap company based in Buford, Georgia, may have one of the better treatments on the market with its TheraSeed, a brachytherapy to fight prostate cancer. <a href=""http://theragenics.com/content/view/15/29/"">Prostate cancer</a> is the most frequently diagnosed cancer, and the leading cause of cancer deaths in men. The American Cancer Society estimates there will be 241,740 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed this year, and an estimated 28,170 will die in the USA due to the disease. Theragenics has treated over 150,000 prostate cancer patients over the last 25 years. The treatment utilizes between 50 to 150 <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=TGX.N"">seeds</a> consisting of biocompatible titanium that encapsulates the radioactive isotope, palladium-103 (Pd-103), which is implanted throughout the prostate using transrectal ultrasound to guide the process. The half-life of Pd-103 is 17 days, resulting in the loss of virtually all radioactivity in less than six months. Theragenics, through its purchase of <a href=""http://news.theragenics.com/press-release/theragenics-acquires-core-oncologys-prostate-brachytherapy-customer-base"">Core Oncology</a> earlier this year, also carries an iodine seed device, I-Seed, that utilizes the radioactive isotope iodine-125 (I-125), with a half-life of approximately 60 days and a loss of almost all radioactivity in approximately 20 months. Both TheraSeed and I-Seed together should help increase the company's revenue in this unique niche market.</p><p>Theragenics is a $43.7 million market cap company, and though solid, its stock is down over 13% YTD and has been flat the past 5 trading sessions where it sits at $1.47 per share in light volume. Last month the company announced its <a href=""http://www.dailyfinance.com/2012/11/08/theragenics-reports-revenue-and-earnings-for-third/"">3rd quarter earnings</a> of $19.9 million, down 5% from the previous year. Earnings per share were $0.02 compared to $0.03 the previous year. Healthcare companies are dealing with the uncertainty of health care reform and a weak economy, which could account, in part, for its lackluster performance. However, Theragenics has established itself over the years as a quality company. In July the company completed a $10 million stock repurchase with cash on hand. Even though the stock has done little since its pre-recession highs, I do like this stock and I can see its product line growing. However, caution and due diligence is advised when investing in any micro-cap company as there can be wild swings, as seen when the stock climbed to $2.10 per share in July, only to drift back downward. But I think the worst is behind it and, as earnings increase, I look for the stock to move upward.</p><p><strong>Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR)</strong>, based in Palo Alto, California, is the world's leading manufacturer of medical devices and software for treating cancer and other medical conditions with radiotherapy, radiosurgery, and brachytherapy. Earlier this month it announced that it has received <a href=""http://www.news-medical.net/news/20121129/Varians-TrueBeam-receives-Indian-AERB-clearance-for-use-in-advanced-radiosurgical-treatments.aspx"">regulatory clearance</a> from the Indian Atomic Energy Regulatory Board for the use of its popular <a href=""http://variantruebeam.utilsblogs.com/"">TrueBeam</a> High Intensity Mode for advanced radiosurgical treatments. TrueBeam is designed to <a href=""http://www.variantruebeam.com/truebeam-varian/faq.html"">treat</a> lung, breast, head and neck, and other cancers that are often treated with radiotherapy. The system uses sophisticated imaging and respiration <a href=""http://www.varian.com/us/oncology/radiosurgery/truebeam-stx.html"">synchronization tools</a> to visualize soft tissue during treatment and make adjustments accordingly. With new beam-shaping capabilities used with the High-Intensity Mode, it enables the delivery of large doses in small targets. TrueBeam treatment can be delivered with sub-millimeter accuracy and varying intensity. The idea is to deliver the lowest dose possible to the surrounding healthy tissue, while still delivering the maximum dose to the tumor. The reason this is big news for the company and investors is that India's population is over one billion. And since the population has adopted a more of a western lifestyle, breast cancer has been dramatically on the rise: 100 thousand new cases of <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2464467/"">breast cancer</a> are reported per year, and it is estimated by 2015 that number will rise to 250 thousand cases per year. Varian has placed a sizeable number of linear accelerators in the country and holds a notable position in the market.</p><p>Varian has a market cap of $7.8 billion with a P/E ratio of 18.44, and offers no dividend. The company announced its quarterly earnings on October 25th, of $1.08 per share beating the analysts' consensus estimate of $1.03 by $0.05. Also its quarterly revenue jumped 5.1% on a year-over-year basis. Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald, which currently have a <em>hold</em> rating on the stock, raised its target price from $63.00 to $70.00 in a research report sent to investors. However, <a href=""http://www.jagsreport.com/2012/12/cantor-fitzgerald-boosts-price-target-on-varian-medical-systems-var/"">analysts</a> at SunTrust initiated coverage on Varian on November 16th, setting a <em>buy</em> rating with an $81.00 price target. Benchmark Co. also set a <em>buy</em> rating on November 16th with an $88.00 price target, while analysts at Zacks reiterated a <em>neutral</em> rating with a $70.00 price target. I like Varian; it has a strong balance sheet, low debt, and a decent amount of cash, which it has been known to use to repurchase its own stock. The caveat in the deck stems from the uncertainty of the effects of the <a href=""http://community.nasdaq.com/News/2012-11/varian-wins-clearance-in-india-analyst-blog.aspx?storyid=194690"">health care reform</a> and weak economy in developed countries, especially those in Europe. However, I see Varian as a good company with a strong business model and solid pipeline of products, and it appears to be a good value stock to have in one's portfolio.</p><p>Radiotherapy is evolving with new devices and therapies. Companies like Varian and Theragenics have a track record of successful devices on the market. Upstart ADMD, on the other hand, is taking a different approach to brachytherapy using an injectable, as opposed to a surgical, procedure in treating cancers. And judging by the success of the Duke University study, the injection method works. That is why I think ADMD, with its Radiogel, has the best chance of the three for its stock to rise significantly. However, until either of its products proves to be successful, ADMD is a speculative investment and there are risks. Radiogel is in its early stages and will require regulatory approval, so caution and due diligence is advised when investing in small companies.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[ADMD.OB]].

"998631","2012-11-11 11:56:28","3 Acquisitions In Biotechnology That Could Occur In The Next Year","<p>Immunotherapy vaccines have been among the most promising therapies in the treatment of various cancers. Currently, there are several late-stage candidates that are seeing strong clinical results, and could possibly change the standard of how cancer is treated. In the last year alone we've seen several acquisitions in the space, approvals, and also advancements into late-stage studies. As a result, with so much promise in the field, and several big name study results in the near future, I think we could see more intensity in acquisitions over the next year. I expect large pharmaceuticals to expand its presence in the immunotherapy arena; and for companies that don't have a presence, they will try to build one. To this end, I am looking at three companies that could potentially be acquired in the next year within the immunotherapy space due to promising pipelines and low market capitalizations.</p><p>Developing the first cancer vaccine to enjoy a regulatory approval, <b>Dendreon (DNDN)</b> broke through barriers with its now-famous prostate cancer vaccine, Provenge. Initially providing shareholders with phenomenal upside, the company has lost nearly 90% of its value since July 2011. The failure to execute its marketing plan, logistical nightmares, and slower adoption has plagued this past powerhouse in the space. The company has seen fairly strong growth, with 28% sales growth during its <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/dendreon-announces-second-quarter-2012-200500266.html"">recent quarter</a>, despite closing its most important facility in New Jersey. The company's costs have plagued its progress, and are still excessive due to the <a href=""http://www.dendreon.com/products/provenge/manufacturing/"">manufacturing</a> and logical requirements involved. It is believed that the company needs to report sales of $150 million per quarter to achieve profitability or $100 million per quarterly to reach positive operating cash flow.</p><p>With competition from Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ) Zytiga and Medivation's (MDVN) Xtandi, Dendreon's chances of reaching peak sales continue to diminish, while the board's willingness to shop the company must be at an all-time high. Dendreon makes an enticing acquisition target for two reasons: First, it still has one of the best vaccines in the treatment of cancer and, second, the company's valuation with a market capitalization of $605 million is appealing with revenue of about $440 over the last 12 months. Ergo, Dendreon could most likely be purchased for a 100% premium, which would only be a price/sales of 3.0.</p><p>Large pharma has a history of trying to compete with pipelines and buying companies to stay ahead of future curves in the treatment of various diseases. Therefore, with several acquisitions in immunotherapy over the last several years, it makes sense that large pharma may snatch up Dendreon, with such an attractive valuation. I think it would make sense for a company such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) to increase its presence in immunotherapy, with both Provenge and Yervoy as part of the combined pipelines. There is also the possibility of additional indications for Provenge, which could mean that an acquirer would be able to acquire Dendreon for just 1.0x future sales. This would be a great acquisition compared to some of the premiums paid in biotechnology. Overall, I think it makes sense; Dendreon's costs have been negatively affected because it is using state-of-the-art facilities for just one drug. But a larger company, such as Bristol-Myers, could easily integrate Provenge with a better network and equal facilities to lower the costs. Just two years ago, Dendreon reached a peak valuation of more than $8 billion, and could now be acquired for less than $1.5 billion.</p><p>My second choice, and my favorite (no surprise), is <b>Galena Biopharma (GALE)</b>. I have often discussed how large pharma prefers to pay premiums versus investing in value. Thus, I don't think this acquisition would occur until later in 2013. Galena is currently trading with a valuation of near $150 million, after a 380% YTD gain; consequently, GALE's value would have to rise before large pharma would show any interest. This may sound crazy, but think about it: When's the last time large pharma bought a biotechnology company for $300 million or even $500 million? For some reason large pharma likes to pay 5-10x peak sales either after an FDA approval or while in late-stage trials. But, if Galena can continue to prove that its vaccine, NeuVax, can and will treat a large unmet medical need in breast cancer patients with low to intermediate levels of HER2, then I think it gets snatched up fairly quickly.</p><p>So which company might purchase Galena Biopharma? I think the best choice would be Roche Holding (RHHBY.PK). Roche's drug, Herceptin, is a near $6 billion per year blockbuster, targeting just 25% to one-third of all breast cancer patients who present high levels of HER2. NeuVax targets those who don't qualify-the ones who have low-intermediate levels of HER2. Galena's Phase 2 study of 187 patients demonstrated a 50% reduction in the rate of recurrence, and its booster program has added to its efficacy. However, the company also has a trial planned to test NeuVax in combination with Herceptin.</p><p>In a <a href=""http://investors.galenabiopharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=631977"">previously reported pilot Phase 2 study</a> of 62 patients, 32 were given trastuzumab (Herceptin) alone and had a 12.5% recurrence rate. But for those patients who receive NeuVax following treatment with trastuzumab, zero recurred following 24 months. The company is now planning a 300 patient randomized Phase 2 trial to test the combination of Herceptin and NeuVax. If effective it makes sense that Roche would acquire Galena, as it will want to control this space-and NeuVax, arguably, has greater market potential if proven to be effective.</p><p>If interim results from its Phase 2 trial, are strong for Galena in December of this year, then I anticipate interest from large pharma. The company has already received a lot of attention from analysts, with its recent <a href=""http://www.dailypolitical.com/finance/stock-market/maxim-group-assumes-coverage-on-galena-biopharma-gale.htm"">&quot;buy&quot; rating</a> and a $6.00 price target from Maxim Group. Naturally, it is starting to attract the eyes of Wall Street. But like I said, the Phase 2 trial of Herceptin+NeuVax will be the determining factor in attracting Roche; and if successful, then Galena will most likely be a billion-dollar company, garnering the interest of large pharma.</p><p>My final acquisition possibility is <b>Celldex Therapeutics (CLDX)</b>, a company with two late-stage products and big revenue potential. The company has two products: Rindopepimut, a Phase 3 immunotherapy for the treatment of glioblastoma in patients who express EGFRvIII, and CDX-011, a candidate being tested on patients who are GPNMB-positive with advanced breast cancer. The company has shown encouraging results from both products, and now investors await overall survival data from its breast cancer drug. An acquisition of Celldex would give large pharma two late-stage candidates with large market potential. Some have estimated that its glioblastoma drug could return sales north of $1 billion, as could the company's late-stage breast cancer product. Not to mention, Celldex is another company gaining a lot of interest from analysts. Jefferies recently reiterated its &quot;<a href=""http://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/12/11/3051442/update-jefferies-company-reiterates-buy-rating-raises-pt"">buy&quot; rating</a> and raised its price target to $7.00.</p><p>With Celldex having two late-stage candidates, each with billion-dollar potential, what company might bid to acquire this $360 million company? This one is a little harder to me, because there are several companies that might show an interest, but no clear winner. There was some benefit in immune response when combining Rindopepimut with Roche-Genentech's Avastin. So it seems fair to infer that, perhaps, Genentech may wish to acquire Celldex. Celldex is also a licensee of Seattle Genetetics' (SGEN) platform for CDX-001; accordingly, Seattle Genetics may want to bid. Furthermore, because of the similarities between CDX-001 and ImmunoGen's (IMGN) T-DM1, perhaps another large pharma company, such as Amgen (AMGN) or Eli Lilly (LLY), may show interest to compete with Genentech (who partnered with ImmunoGen) and GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Tykerb. Overall, there appears to be a lot of options for Celldex, not to mention current partners, and I think these options will be explored after overall survival data is announced for CDX-011, which may be its most attractive product.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[GALE]], [[LLY]].

"1013311","2012-11-16 07:07:33","Recent Data Presented At Melanoma Conference Offers Hope For Patients, Research For Investors","<p>This week's 6th annual World Meeting of Interdisciplinary Melanoma/Skin Cancer Centers held in conjunction with the 8th annual EADO Congress in Barcelona, Spain provided investors, healthcare providers and patients with a wealth of information on the current advances in melanoma research. In <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1000421-upcoming-melanoma-conference-is-an-excellent-source-of-small-pharma-investor-information"">a recent article</a> that I wrote earlier this week, I delved into some companies that were presenting data or mentioned in the conference's program along with some closely associated companies that might be affected by promising trial data. Following are some of the data presented and their implications for the companies developing those therapies. For additional information on the data, please view the <a href=""http://www.melanoma2012.com/welcome-letter"">conference website</a> and associated press releases from the companies presenting the data.</p><p><strong>OncoSec Medical (ONCS.OB)</strong> presented two sets of data at the conference. Wednesday, the company announced <a href=""http://www.sacbee.com/2012/11/14/4984486/oncosec-medical-reports-positive.html""><span>Phase</span> IV data for its NeoPulse therapy</a> for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. NeoPulse utilizes an electroporation device to apply an electrical current across targeted tumors, increasing the cellular membranes' permeability by 4,000 - 10,000-fold. This allows the pre-injected chemotherapy agent, bleomycin in this case, to effectively penetrate the cancer cells where it is trapped once the current is removed. The premise behind the regimen is to more accurately place the bleomycin where it can be most effective and leave less circulating in the body to have undesired side effects. Data from the 88-patient trial yielded a complete response of greater than 92.8% in basal cell carcinoma patients and 70% in squamous cell carcinoma patients at six months (of 69 evaluable patients). The conclusion on the poster noted &quot;Electrochemotherapy appears to provide local control with the potential advantage of preserving normal tissue and therefore warrants further exploration as an alternative or even adjuvant treatment in cutaneous skin cancers.&quot;</p><p>Yesterday, the company followed up its NeoPulse presentation with interim data from a promising phase 2 therapy of its <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-medical-reports-positive-preliminary-efficacy-results-from-phase-ii-study-of-immunopulse-in-metastatic-melanoma-patients"">ImmunoPulse platform in metastatic melanoma</a>. OncoSec's ImmunoPulse program, like the NeoPulse, utilizes electroporation to more effectively administer a cancer treatment agent, but for this program the agent is DNA IL-12, a plasmid DNA construct with instructions for the cells to produce the IL-12 cytokine. Once inside the cells, the agent causes the targeted them to produce the IL-12 cytokine. Once ignored by the immune system, the newly expressed IL-12 triggers the patient's immunity system into action via circulating macrophages and cytotoxic T-cells. In other words, cancer cells once ignored by the immune system are now targeted and attacked. The most exciting part of the regimen is that, unlike the NeoPulse treatment, ImmunoPulse's response extends beyond the targeted tissue/tumors. Cancer tumors throughout the body are targeted by the immune system, potentially leading to a system-wide immune response against the tumors.</p><p>Leading into the data, the readership should first be familiarized with some medical terms. All definitions are from the <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary"">National Cancer Institute website</a>. Stable disease <span>((SD))</span> is defined as &quot;Cancer that is neither decreasing nor increasing in extent or severity.&quot; Partial response (PR) is defined as &quot;A decrease in the size of a tumor, or in the extent of cancer in the body, in response to treatment. Also called partial remission.&quot; Complete response <span>((CR))</span> is defined as &quot;The disappearance of all cancer in response to treatment. Also called complete remission.&quot; Data presented on Friday and released in Monday's press release noted eleven (of thirteen total enrolled) subjects were evaluable at 39 days, six at 90 days and two at 180 days. All treated lesions demonstrated response at 39 days (10% SD, 50% PR, 40% CR), at 90 days results were (44% PR, 56% CR) and at 180 days (43% PR and 57% CR). At 180 days, two subjects were evaluable for ORR (by trial design, ORR is to be measured at 180 days, so more updates here in the coming months will be critical). Of the two evaluable patients, one had a confirmed stable disease. The second patient had a near complete response of all treated and untreated lesions.</p><p>With a recent CE mark authorization to its credit on <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/oncosec-receives-ce-mark-electroporation-100700813.html"">October 17th</a> for its OMS gene and drug delivery system, promising data for its phase 2 ImmunoPulse Merkel cell carcinoma trial on <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-medical-incorporated-reports-positive-preliminary-efficacy-and-safety-results-from-phase-ii-study-of-immunopulse-in-merkel-cell-carcinoma-patients"">October 23rd</a>, the positive data for its NeoPulse melanoma trial reported on November 14 and promising data yesterday for its <span>Phase II</span> ImmunoPulse metastatic melanoma trial behind it, OncoSec should have plenty of positive catalysts ahead in 2013. The company should still be considered a development-phase company as it has not yet begun generating revenue with its platform and is still operating at a loss. Investors should perform a careful risk assessment on the company while taking into consideration its pipeline, its targeted indications, the company's financials and its OTCBB status.</p><p><strong>Vical Incorporated's (VICL)</strong> Allovectin was mentioned on the <a href=""http://www.melanoma2012.com/program.pdf"">program</a> for the conference. However, I am unable to find any presentations or press releases indicating that data was presented. Investors are advised to continue watching for Allovectin's <span>Phase III</span> data updates of which topline data should be presented in mid 2013. An immunotherapy agent, Allovectin induces the expression of the two genes, HLA-B7 and &beta;2 microglobulin, that together form an MHC class 1 complex. The therapy is injected intratumorally where it initiates an immune response, locally and systemically against that tumor type. Vical gave an update on its ongoing <span>Phase III</span> trial <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/vical-reports-third-quarter-2012-113000333.html"">November 7th</a>, and that resource may be a good starting point for interested investors. Efficacy and safety information on the trial should both be considered as well as the remainder of the company's pipeline and targeted market group.</p><p>Vical Incorporated is now trading just above its 52-week low of 2.77. Investors should watch to see if the downtrend continues while awaiting <span>Phase III</span> data in mid 2013. With markets trading in some turmoil for the small pharma sector, a small capitalization company such as Vical may see more downside with the next major catalyst several months away. This should provide for ample opportunities for new investors to make educated, wise and low entries into the company's depressed shares.</p><p><strong>Amgen, Inc's (AMGN)</strong> T-VEC (formerly OncoVEX) was listed on the program on November 14th in a plenary session with Axel Hauschild, MD listed as the speaker (Dr. Hauschild is listed elsewhere as the president of the president of the Interdisciplinary Global Conference on Developing New Treatments for Melanoma). As of the date of this publication, no poster presentation or announcement on the data has been released. Although not likely a large share price mover for the company, investors in Amgen should consider the data to be significant as it will help to validate or debunk the company's decision to purchase privately-held BioVex Group on March of 2011 for $1 billion (including milestone payments for the late-phase OncoVEX cancer therapy). With the overall markets trading lower in recently, negative data for the phase 3 trial could cause an over-exaggerated selloff for Amgen's stock, which is trading near its 52-week high. Investors who firmly believe in Amgen's long-term possibilities, even without T-VEC in its pipeline, could use such a <span>sell-off</span> to open a long position in the company's shares if it should happen.</p><p><strong>Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY)</strong> Yervoy (ipilumumab) was listed on the program for Barcelona, but no press release announcing data has been released. I had mentioned in my previous article on the conference that there was a possibility of <span>Phase II</span> data evaluating Yervoy to treat NY-ESO-1 expressed melanoma being presented. Although the monoclonal antibody does not directly target NY-ESO-1 antigens, it does target the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), a negative regulator of T-cell activation. This deregulation enables the body's naturally occurring T-cells to attack cancer cells with certain expressions, in this case those with NY-ESO-1 antigens. Not only would <span>Phase II</span> data verify or deny ipilumumab for this specific indication, but positive data could indicate an advanced competitor for <strong>Celldex Therapeutics' (CLDX)</strong> early-stage CDX-1401, as it also targets the NY-ESO-1 antigens in its melanoma treatment approach. As of the date of this article, no data has been released by Bristol-Myers and there was no mention of the trial at the conference's poster sessions. There was a brief note on Thursday's guided poster tour on a posted titled &quot;Ipilimumab Induced Simultaneous Regression of Melanocytic Nevi and Melanoma Metastases&quot;. On that poster was the statement &quot;CTLA-4 antibodies generate immune responses to the melanoma-associated antigens Melan-A, NY-ESO-1, and gp100 in metastatic melanoma&quot;, giving more credibility to the possible success of Yervoy in this particular indication which would have a solid head start on Celldex's CDX-1401.</p><p>Data announced on <a href=""http://ir.celldextherapeutics.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=716788"">October 29</a>th for the <span>Phase I</span> trial of CDX-1401 to treat patients having solid tumors were promising in the trial in which the therapy was used in combination with the toll-like receptor <span>((TLR))</span> agonists resiquimod and/or Poly ICLC (Hiltonol). The patient set included 45 patients with advanced malignancies (21 melanoma, 6 ovarian, 5 sarcoma, 4 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 4 colorectal, 5 other). The data set as presented on the press release was a bit confusing due to the multiple indications targeted at once. However, pertinent to the subject at hand was the statement &quot;Approximately 54% of patients with NY-ESO-1 positive tumors had anti-NY-ESO-1 titers at baseline and most increased after vaccination. Humoral responses were elicited in both NY-ESO-1 positive and negative patients. NY-ESO-1-specific T cell responses were absent or low at baseline, but increased post-vaccination in 53% (18/34) of evaluable patients, including both CD4 and/or CD8 T cell responses<span> &hellip;</span> Importantly, a well-tolerated and immunogenic regimen has been identified to take forward into the future study.&quot; Investors interested in Celldex should continue watching for Yervoy's <span>Phase II</span> trial for melanoma. Although not a significant source of the share price run up in 1H 2012 (that hype was due to Rindopepimut trials for glioblastoma and a CDX-011 trial for breast cancer), CDX-1401 does add diversification to the company's product portfolio. Even if unsuccessful for melanoma or if it has solid competition for the melanoma indication, the NY-ESO-1 target in solid tumors still has multiple other indications it can potentially address such as colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, NSCLC, sarcomas and others if having the NY-ESO-1 over-expression.</p><p>Celldex shares, like many of those in the small pharmaceutical sector, are currently under pressure with a downtrend in place since its $6.55 close on October 4th. Shares are now trading at the $5.00 support with a market capitalization of $315 million. Interested investors should watch this support level closely to ascertain if it holds or breaks through. If a long position is opened at this level, a tight stop limit may be a wise decision to minimize loss. The company has a robust pipeline with <a href=""http://www.celldextherapeutics.com/wt/page/cancer"">multiple indications</a> targeted, particular in its primary focus, cancer. This diversification also helps to protect against significant downside, as failure in one therapy for a particular indication would not necessarily be construed as a potential failure for another indication or with a different therapy.</p><p>Each of the presented companies has something to offer for varying types of investors. OncoSec's successes so far, a low market capitalization of $29 million and potential upcoming catalysts represent a high risk versus high reward type of investment in a company that is rapidly emerging with a novel approach to treating cancer. Vical should offer patient investors a more solid entry in the coming days as its major catalyst is still several months away, timing in entry at a bottom before interest returns in advance of the <span>Phase III</span> unveiling will be key. Celldex has many catalysts in its varied pipeline predominantly targeting cancer. With three trials in either <a href=""http://www.celldextherapeutics.com/wt/page/pipeline_redirect""><span>Phase II or III</span> clinicals</a>, the company has multiple &quot;make it or break it&quot; catalysts upcoming. Positive data in either of these three trials could provide for solid upside, while the downside should be somewhat protected with the other trials' possibilities likely intact. Amgen and Bristol-Myers each offers investors the benefit of solid revenue, multiple marketed products and a much more protected downside than the three smaller market capitalization options noted. They also pay out quarterly dividends in the amounts of $0.36 and $0.34, respectively, adding to their investment quality.</p><p>Investors, healthcare providers and patients may view the posters at the conference themselves on its website through the program via this <a href=""http://www.melanoma2012.com/program.pdf"">link</a>, rather than through the abstracts link which does not appear to have any data as of yet.

"1296671","2013-03-24 01:04:57","The Blitz: Are These Stocks Presenting Upside?","<p>Last week's &quot;Blitz&quot; created great discussions and produced questions that have been tremendous. This week I am looking at several stock-specific questions, while in previous weeks I have looked at diversification related topics. I will continue to take questions through Seeking Alpha, <a href=""http://nicholstoday.com/"">NicholsToday.com</a>, or through <a href=""https://twitter.com/bnichols9883"">Twitter</a> in the week prior to future postings. This week's questions cover broad topics. Therefore, I hope you enjoy, learn, and at the end, feel free to chime in.</p><p><a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1281501-the-weekend-blitz-finding-value-market-behavior-diversification-related-plays"">Click here</a> to see last weeks &quot;Blitz&quot;.</p><p>DRhino asks, &quot;<b>Is Galena Biopharma's (GALE) <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/galena-biopharma-acquires-abstral-r-070000289.html"">acquisition of Abstral</a>, good news or bad news for investors?&quot;</b></p><p>Yes, I think it is great news! When I woke Monday morning to learn that Galena had acquired the fentanyl sublingual tablet for the management of breakthrough cancer pain, Abstral, I was shocked to see that the stock did not double.</p><p>Some bears may say that the use of fentanyl will be small, and that this will not be a success. However, consider the fact that the market potential is $400 million, and that it returned sales of $54 million in Europe alone (in 2012)! Furthermore, it is growing rapidly in Europe, having reached 29% of its potential market, and reporting <a href=""http://www.pharmpro.com/news/2013/03/orexo-sells-abstral%C2%AE-united-states-galena-biopharma-inc"">growth of 42% in Q4 2012</a> compared to the year prior!</p><p>With European growth of 40%, $54 million in its first full-year of launch, and great penetration into the European market, how big is this news? I think it's massive! Consider the fact that last year <b>ACADIA Pharmaceuticals (ACAD),</b> which is a highly promising company that I deeply respect, met both primary and secondary endpoints for its drug, pimavanserin, in a <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/ACAD.O/key-developments/article/2649389"">Phase 2 study</a>. Now, the company has seen its market cap increase from $120 million to $650 million based on the potential approval of one product that has peak sales potential of about $300 million. Therefore, now that Galena has an approved product that could reach similar peak sales, and has a market cap of $130 million, with its biggest product still in Phase 3, I say it's worth at minimum one times peak sales, which may still be too cheap. In my opinion, this makes sense; if ACADIA is trading at 2.5 times peak sales without ever selling a product then Galena has to be worth at least one times peak sales with a proven product that is growing by 42% year-over-year!</p><p>With all things considered, I can't see how the acquisition is not good. I think it will help build the company's network and that it will prevent further dilution, which is evident by the company's decision to enter into non-dilutive financing. On a side note, I think Grant Zeng wrote a phenomenal article explaining the acquisition, and I urge you to <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1289581-a-great-move-for-galena-biopharma"">read it here</a>. My bottom line is that I think <a href=""http://www.dailypolitical.com/life-2/galena-biopharma-pt-raised-to-6-00-gale.htm"">Maxim Group's price target of $6</a> (announced on Tuesday) is much more appropriate than its current price at $2.00, and that the company just went from an undervalued clinical stock to a deeply undervalued growth stock by basically bypassing clinical trials on a product with a very large market; this was a company-changing home run!</p><p>Seeking Alpha user, <i>stmf45</i>, asks, <b>&quot;Would STX be just as attractive without its yield?&quot;</b></p><p>When you decide on an investment you are doing so with the collected information. It's all pieces of the puzzle that come together to determine whether or not you buy. In regards to <b>Seagate Technologies (STX),</b> this is a company that is paying a forward dividend yield of 4.40%, after increasing its yield a whopping 19% last November. It's also a company that returned 95% of its operating cash flow in the form of share redemptions and dividends in the first half of fiscal 2013, making it among the most shareholder friendly companies in the entire market. To better explain, take a look at the chart below so that you can see just how much cash this company has returned to shareholders over the last four quarters.</p><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0""><tr><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p>Quarter/Fiscal Year 2012-2013</p></td><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p>Cash to Shareholders (millions)</p></td><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p>Operating Cash-Flow (millions)</p></td></tr> <tr><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p>Q2/2013</p></td><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p>$1,100</p></td><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p>$844</p></td></tr> <tr><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p>Q1/2013</p></td><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p>$796</p></td><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p>$1,100</p></td></tr> <tr><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p>Q4/2012</p></td><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p>$1,300</p></td><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p>$1,400</p></td></tr> <tr><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p>Q3/2012</p></td><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p>$1,200*</p></td><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p>$938</p></td></tr> <tr><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p><b>TOTAL</b></p></td><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p><b>$4,396</b></p></td><td width=""266"" valign=""top""><p><b>$4,282</b></p></td></tr></table><p>*Also includes early retirement of debt</p><p>The question of, &quot;Would Seagate still be good without the dividend?&quot; is a good one because much of Seagate's investment upside lies in the company's willingness to return cash.</p><p>While dividend investors look at the facts found on the chart above, you must also look at its fundamentals, because there are many bears for STX. Those who are bearish on STX have a negative outlook on the hard disk drive (HDD) industry. These drives are mostly used in PCs and laptops, which have seen a decline since the emergence of smartphones and tablets. However, these bears forget to address the company's presence in game consoles, supercomputers, medical imaging devices, home entertainment systems, DVRs, and even in the Cloud. HDDs are required to handle the large amount of storage that is kept in the Cloud. Thus, Seagate benefits from this transition-and according to its recent quarter, the company is creating next-generation hardware and software solutions for solid-state storage markets. This type of storage is used in a lot of smartphones and tablets, from companies such as <b>OCZ Technology (OCZ)</b> and <b>Fusion-IO (FIO)</b>. However, the margins are low in the solid-state storage space, and Seagate is a company with margins over 20%. Hence, &quot;next generation&quot; most likely alludes to the company's goal to develop and enter the market while maintaining high margins.</p><p>As you can see, despite a slow PC/laptop market, this is a company with a lot of upside. And when I look at the stocks P/E ratio of less than 4.50 and its price/sales of 0.78, I believe that without a shadow-of-a-doubt that STX is a &quot;buy&quot;. However, if you remove the $1.1 billion last quarter given back to shareholders, and its massive yield, then you can see that it's an undervalued company in a struggling industry. So, because of its value, I still think the stock is attractive, but not nearly to the same degree as a Seagate that returns over 100% of its cash flow to investors.</p><p>NicholsToday.com user, <i>Keahi</i>, asks, <b>&quot;Do you use downside stops? If so, do you use larger stops when investing in volatile stocks?</b></p><p>Here's a question that is in response to the strategic investing section of my book. It plays off the emotion of investors, and I believe that it is absolutely crucial that investors use stop-loss orders in their investment strategy. The reason is simple: It's because we as humans are naturally illogical, and when faced with money-gaining or losing situations we almost can't help but to overreact.</p><p>Allow me to share a perfect example of overreaction/panic, and why using stop-loss orders are imperative. <b>Santarus (SNTS)</b> is a company with approved products, a large pipeline, and is a company growing rapidly. Last quarter it grew sales 65%, drastically improved margins, and gave great guidance for the upcoming year. As a result, the stock has been on the uptrend; but on Monday when premarket losses were greater than 1% (thanks to the debacle in Cyprus) the stock, along with many others, opened with massive losses as investors panicked. The stock then fell to $15.80, but then immediately rose back to over $16.50, and then popped over $17.00 the following day.</p><p>Needless to say, there were a lot of people in deep regret after panicking on Monday, but those regrets could have been avoided if people would use stop-loss and limit orders to limit their involvement with a stock. I have talked about this often; the key is to set a stop-loss based on your risk tolerance right after you purchase a stock. The reason you do it after purchasing is because, if you have performed proper research, then you should be thinking clearer at that point compared to a volatile trading day. As for the second part of the question, you definitely adjust your stop-loss according to investments. If you buy a large cap high-yield stock then your investment will most likely be large and your downside risk will be smaller. However, if you buy a speculative biotechnology stock then your investment will be smaller, but your risk will be much greater. Therefore, you have to assess your own risk based on the size of the investment and the type of investment.</p><p>NicholsToday.com user, <i>redralph</i>, asks, <b>&quot;Have you changed your outlook for LinkedIn now that it has traded higher?&quot;</b></p><p>There is one thing that cannot change my outlook on a company, and that is the performance of its stock. However, since the number one goal of investing is to return more money than your investment, those who bought <b>LinkedIn (LNKD)</b> last year were right; I was wrong.</p><p>It's probably good to start by saying that I never said that LinkedIn wasn't an efficient business, but I do believe that it is way too expensive and I am not sure that it can stand the test of time. In my opinion, a lasting social media company must have interaction, and on LinkedIn there is very little interaction. Personally, I have 892 connections, and of those connections I don't believe that I have ever commented on any post and I believe I can count on two hands how many people have commented on my posts since I joined. With the exception of endorsed skills and receiving random spam emails, there is too little of interaction; and while I appreciate the career-based purpose of the company, I don't believe it is worth $19 billion!</p><p>LinkedIn is currently trading with a trailing P/E ratio of 900.00 and more importantly a price/sales ratio of 19.55. Therefore, with a price/sales of almost 20, how much do investors expect this company to grow? If LinkedIn is going to become a company that stands the test of time, then sooner or later the valuation has to correct to reflect fundamentals, and this price/sales will retreat to a level around 5.00 (much like Google), and that's if the company can continue to grow. Accordingly, LinkedIn would need two years of 100% growth and flat trading to reach this level. But already growth is slowing. Allow me to explain.</p><p>The natural cycle of a company is that growth will slow year-over-year as it becomes larger. Last year, LinkedIn grew 86% (between 2011 and 2012). In the year prior, between 2010 and 2011, the company's growth was 115% year-over-year. With 115% growth in 2011, 86% growth in 2012, and then 81% growth in its most recent quarter, it is obvious that the company is commanding a larger piece of its market and that growth is slowing. As a result, it might need four or five years of flat returns to trade at a level that is consistent with market leaders such as Google.</p><p>Instead of LinkedIn, I think <b>Facebook (FB)</b> is actually more attractive. While I believe both are expensive, Facebook's price/sales of 12.40 is much more attractive and, believe it or not, Facebook, with a much larger market, may actually be increasing its growth. For example, last year it grew revenue by 37% over 2011. However, in its most <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-reports-fourth-quarter-full-210700713.html"">recent quarter</a> the company grew revenue by 40%, and just recently launched new services such as Graph Search Beta, Gifts, etc., which could all boost sales. Furthermore, using market caps compared to users, each user on Facebook is valued at $59.00 compared to LinkedIn's $93.00. I wonder how much larger a premium can the market place on LinkedIn, and how much more can it monetize its members? With Facebook, I see a company that is just now tapping into its potential growth, and although expensive, I would pay more for the upside potential, but not for LinkedIn.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>If you have a question about any of the stocks I follow, a market-related question, or would like my opinion on a specific topic, please feel free to send me an email or provide feedback in the comments section below. The goal of this series is to provide analysis from the previous week, or to talk about market-related events that might change the direction of the market.

"1046411","2012-12-05 10:34:37","Targeted Radiation Looks To Create And Grow Revenue","<p>The evolution of novel cancer therapeutics has led to many innovations in treating the disease. Immunotherapies and antibodies have become popular in recent years, but remain second-tier treatments. Radiotherapy, or radiation treatment, has long since been the treatment of choice in fighting cancer, but some have elected to focus on newer and safer cancer targeting therapeutics. Innovations in radiation-based therapies have transpired in recent years, and companies are now finding a more effective targeted approach with radiation-based treatments. However, these companies must now continue to develop, fight regulatory hurdles, and capitalize on the market potential to become effective in a competitive space. Therefore, I aim to look at companies with radiation-based therapeutics that have the potential to return large gains in the years that lie ahead.</p><p><strong>Spectrum Pharmaceuticals' (SPPI)</strong> Zevalin is an FDA approved product that is highly effective but has underperformed in sales year-after-year. The <a href=""http://www.zevalin.com/"">drug is administered</a> as a combo of Rituxan and the medical isotope yttrium-90. Hence, it is a radio immunotherapy, but uses an antibody conjugated with radioisotopes. It might sound confusing, but most effective cancer therapies are a bit complicated.</p><p>Zevalin is currently being used as a treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ((NHL)); despite significant advantages over the competition, regulatory hurdles have negatively impacted its sales. Zevalin has an 83% <a href=""http://investor.spectrumpharm.com/events.cfm"">overall response</a> at treating NHL compared to Rituximab's 55%; however, Rituximab is a highly successful drug, and Zevalin has not been able to achieve the same presence within its targeted market.</p><p>Spectrum Pharmaceuticals has three FDA-approved drugs, and Zevalin is arguably its most promising. The company's CEO has spoken at various <a href=""http://investor.spectrumpharm.com/events.cfm"">conferences</a> in the last six months and has used Zevalin as a selling point to potential investors. As of now, it is a drug achieving about 10% of its potential $400 million in sales.</p><p>Last year the company did make progress after a <a href=""http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111121005525/en/FDA-Approves-Removal-Bioscan-Requirement-ZEVALIN%c2%ae-Treatment"">labeling change</a> removed a required imaging scan from the requirements of using the drug. Most believed it was this scan, and the high costs, that had prevented Zevalin from seeing higher sales. Now with the scan being lifted, the drug being more affordable, and the company working to eliminate additional costs associated with the logistics of its use, Spectrum could see increased sales in 2013 and could lead the charge for other companies that are developing similar products.</p><p>In terms of performance, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals is a $680 million company that is projecting $300 million in total sales for 2012. If the company reaches its goal it would have posted sales growth of more than 50% compared to 2011. However, none of the company's growth was related to Zevalin, and looking ahead to 2013, the company is already seeing slowed growth from its lead product Fusilev. Therefore, Zevalin must contribute, and if so, this could be a stock to produce significant gains, but the company must do a better job at execution.</p><p><strong>Immunomedics, Inc. (IMMU)</strong> is a $250 million company with two approved products: one for the detection of Human Anti-Murine Antibodies (HAMA) and the other is LeukoScan, used for diagnostic imaging. The company has a huge pipeline, including a promising product for the treatment of late-stage pancreatic cancer. The company's product, Y-90 Clivatuzmab Tetraxetan is a radioimmunotherapy that targets an antigen found in most pancreatic cancers.</p><p>The company's radioimmunotherapy consists of the same medical isotope found in Zevalin, Y-90, which is highly effective at treating cancer. In the past, this form of cancer would be difficult to target, but Immunomedics uses its technology to target the cells and can then directly apply a therapeutic level of Y-90 to treat the disease. This product has been granted an Orphan Drug designation, and now investors are hoping it continues to produce similar results as at the <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/immunomedics-reports-final-survival-data-130000728.html"">ASCO meeting</a> earlier this year. If the company can maintain or stay close to its 9.3 month overall survival for patients receiving multiple cycles, then it will further validate the potential of targeted radiation as a form of treatment to cancer.</p><p>In terms of pricing and stock, IMMU has lost more than 15% of its valuation in the last two and a half months. Much of the company's loss was a result of a <a href=""http://www.thestreet.com/story/11766514/1/immunomedics-inc-stock-downgraded-immu.html"">recent downgrade by TheStreet</a>. This comes due to excessive spending: The company's loss rose 44% during its last quarter, which further adds to its $224 million accumulated loss. The company's spending, cash flow, and balance sheet, has been a concern, but if its product proves to be effective then perhaps this concern will prove itself to be meaningless to shareholders.</p><p><strong>Nordion (NDZ)</strong> is a diversified medical isotope-focused company that has seen its fair share of problems in the last year. Recently, Canada denied the construction of the <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/4500011-nordion-provides-update-on-maple-arbitration-costs-proceedings"">MAPLE facilities</a>, which was to be the company's plan for replacing the NRU reactor once it shut down in the coming year. The stock has now lost more than 35% of its value in the last six months, as investors prepare for the company to see a third of its revenue wiped out (more than $70 million annually). However, the company is progressing in other areas, with its Targeted Therapies segment.</p><p>In the last year, more than a quarter of Nordion's revenue came from its targeted therapies segment. This segment is driven by sales from the company's liver cancer treatment, TheraSphere, a radiation treatment used to treat inoperable liver cancer. The company has used the same targeted approach that has been discussed in this article, a high-dose of radiation with few side effects directed to the site of the tumor. In the last two years sales from this segment have slowed, but are still growing at a compound rate of 40% over the last five years. But much like Zevalin, investors believe there is great upside to this treatment, and that sales could grow rapidly because it's administered as an outpatient treatment.</p><p>As an approved treatment and if the company can grow sales, it would benefit the space and the outlook for targeted radiation treatments. Nordion is a company with great relationships in the medical community because of its medical isotope business, and has the potential to significantly grow sales. However, Nordion must capitalize on this opportunity for the sake of its future and for investors, because with the NRU closing and no option for its medical isotope business, the company will be redefined in the coming years, one way or the other.</p><p>The final company is <strong>Advanced Medical Isotope Corp. (ADMD.OB),</strong> and although it is an OTC company, and carries more associated risk, it does have great potential in this space. The company has increased in valuation by more than 130% in the last six months, partially as a result of Nordion's failure to find a medical isotope supply when its NRU reactor closes. This affects ADMD because it has a <a href=""http://www.isotopeworld.com/news/13/"">partnership</a> with the only U.S. reactor that can handle demand, the MURR reactor. The company has already <a href=""http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=ADMD"">said</a> that it aims to control half of the Mo-99 supply in the next few years; and thanks to Canada's unwillingness to repair its nuclear reactors, it looks as though it will. Furthermore, the U.S. has always been resistant to bringing isotope production to the country, but the government has <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/07/fact-sheet-encouraging-reliable-supplies-molybdenum-99-produced-without-"">said</a> that it would be willing if able to minimize the use of highly enriched uranium ((HEU)), which is a very dangerous substance.</p><p>ADMD's technology consists of Low Enriched Uranium ((LEU)), which further adds to the optimism that this small company will benefit from Nordion's collapse in the medical isotope business, which is valued at roughly $70 million per year. Advanced Medical Isotopes has a very experienced team of executives who formed this company on the notion of future regulatory changes, and are placing their bets on the belief that large scale production will be brought to the U.S. in the coming year. However, there is a risk that this does not occur, or perhaps another reactor besides the MURR is chosen for supply. Although unlikely that the U.S. would allow a reactor other than MURR to produce Mo-99, it is a risk that investors must consider.</p><p>Aside from production, Advanced Medical Isotope is also developing its own targeted radiation treatment. The company <a href=""http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/news.html?d=251532"">licensed</a> a technology from Battelle to develop a high-dose radiation therapy called &quot;radiogel&quot;. The product uses the same isotope as Spectrum and Immunomedics, Y-90, which works by delivering the radiation directly to the tumor in a water-based biodegradable polymer. After injected, the radiogel's liquid polymer is warmed by the patient's body temperature, which then traps the isotope inside the region that is affected. Thus, not only is the cancer effectively targeted, but the gel is unable to escape, resulting in minimal side effects and a more effective therapy. This treatment is believed to work on any cancer that cannot be surgically removed, and will be tested to determine the range of its potential.</p><p>In terms of potential revenue, the company has <a href=""http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/news.html?d=251532"">said</a> that sales could reach $5 million to $15 million in 2013, and up to $100 million possible. Right now the company has minimal revenue, producing medical isotopes but not on a large scale. Therefore, its gains have been a result of speculation, not fundamental improvements. However, if radiogel does achieve the targeted sales next year, and its possible revenue, combined with the $70 million from the medical isotope business, this stock has a lot of potential in this sector. Trading with a market cap of just $20 million, it could appreciate to a worth north of $150 million based on two times sales in the next three years. Not to mention, Nordion's most profitable business has often been medical isotopes, which is why Advanced Medical is excited about its opportunity and Nordion is not looking forward to seeing it go.</p><p>The business of targeted radiation is growing, but is still undervalued. It has a great deal of potential and could appreciate in the coming years. For each of the noted companies, radiation-based therapies will be very important to the valuation and trends of each company. As a result, with large potential and effective treatments, it makes these four stocks very interesting to monitor in the coming years.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[SPPI]], [[ADMD.OB]].

Please be aware of the</em> <em>dangers associated with these stocks.)</em></p><p>Since <b>Dendreon's</b> <b>(DNDN)</b> FDA approval of Provenge, companies have spent billions on research to learn the best methods to harvest the immune system and fight cancer. Clearly, Dendreon took a wrong turn at some point in Provenge's development. Because although effective, Provenge's manufacturing, cost structure, and survival benefit is limited compared to newer therapeutics in development. One of those newer therapeutics is a class called anti-PD-1s, and if the last year is any indication, these anti-PD-1s will be the focal point for the future of treating cancer, both alone and in combination with other therapeutics.

As a result, the immune system can then fight the disease, which is the concept of immunotherapy, by being able to recognize the cancer. In regards to Bristol-Myers and Merck, both presented some of the best data we've seen in treating cancer.</p><p>Bristol-Myers' new anti-PD1 candidate, nivolumab, <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/6706591-bristol-myers-squibb-announces-phase-1-results-from-first-trial-combining-immune-checkpoint-inhibitors-investigational-agent-nivolumab-and-yervoy-ipilimumab-in-patients-with-advanced-melanoma"">produced very strong results</a> at ASCO in treating melanoma. Overall, in five different doses, nivolumab produced meaningful tumor shrinkage in 31% of patients. Moreover, the overall response rate in patients treated with 3mg was 41%, thus showcasing very strong anti-tumor activity. Bristol-Myers is now testing this dose in a Phase 3 trial and is looking to combine the drug with its blockbuster, Yervoy. Then, most analysts expect further development in combination with other agents to fight different forms of cancer. Hence, investors can identify a pattern where the development of this one approach leads to billions across a variety of cancers.</p><p>With Merck, its anti-PD-1 drug, labrolizumab, <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/100785444"">produced even better results</a>. It saw meaningful tumor shrinkage in 38% of advanced melanoma patients, including 52% in one patient population. This data compares favorably to Bristol's average and best dosage. However, both pieces of data are extraordinary, and investors are excited as both companies begin testing these products on other indications such as lung, breast, and kidney cancers.</p><p>Currently, Bristol-Myers is further ahead in the development race of its anti-PD-1, thus meaning that it will gain an edge by launching its product first. However, Merck is not far behind, about a year, so by having a more effective product it begs to reason that Merck could come out the long-term winner with its anti-PD-1 product, used as an individual treatment. However, we do not yet know how each product will test in treating other diseases such as breast or kidney cancers. Merck clearly has the more effective drug for melanoma, but Bristol's drug could be more effective in lung cancer. As a result, analysts have been generous in predicting peak sales estimates, possibly exceeding $5 billion respectively for each product.</p><p><b>More Following Suit with Combination Therapies</b></p><p>Bristol-Myers and Merck made the anti-PD-1 approach famous, and could earn many billions in annual revenue with each respective product. However, this is just the start of the anti-PD-1 story, as companies are finding that the most effective therapeutic, might be to combine the cancer-identifying approach of anti-PD-1 with other cancer killing agents. Thus, attacking the disease from two or more different angles, which might produce even greater clinical results.</p><p>Just a couple weeks ago, <b>AstraZeneca</b> (AZN) made news when <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/14/us-astrazeneca-cancer-idUSBRE99D0EN20131014"">management discussed a new plan</a> to use combination therapies to fight cancer. AstraZeneca had been criticized over the last year(s), as its pipeline apparently lagged a bit in respect to innovating with the newest technologies. The company's goal is to use anti-PD-1s, but combine it with both small molecule pills and injectable biologics. The idea is to attack the cancer from as many fronts as possible, and AstraZeneca is expected to use candidates such as MEDI4376 and tremelimumab in order to do so.</p><p>If successful, this would be a major win for both the company and shareholders. AstraZeneca is a massive company with over $26 billion in revenue during the last 12 months. However, the company's revenue and margins have both fallen with the loss of patent protection for several of its best-selling drugs. Now, the company's aggressive plan to ramp up its development of combination therapies might give it an edge, or lead to additional acquisitions. Either way, shareholders should benefit from this newfound sense of urgency on behalf of management.</p><p>Looking throughout the market, it seems as though more companies are preparing to take the results made famous by the likes of Merck and Bristol, but then add a combination twist. Bristol-Myers is testing its nivolumab with Yervoy, a combination that some believe could produce sales over $5 billion annually. Also, by combining nivolumab with Yervoy Bristol-Myers might find that it's more effective than Merck's anti-PD-1, thus Bristol-Myers would have the best treatment. However, Merck's management is not sitting on their hands and hoping for the best. Instead, they too are testing other therapeutics with labrolizumab. Clearly, AstraZeneca has already been working with these combination approaches, but so are a lot of small companies as well.</p><p><b>A Small Company with Big Combinations</b></p><p>One of the most notable small companies that is testing this approach might be <b>Lion Biotechnologies (LBIO)</b> helmed by Dr. Manish Singh. Singh was formerly the CEO of <b>ImmunoCellular Therapeutics (IMUC)</b> and made famous his multiple-antigen targeting approach at a time when immunotherapy was stealing the biotechnology spotlight. ImmunoCellular's ICT-107 has produced the best results ever seen in fighting glioblastoma multiforme, more than doubling overall survival in terms of months, and did so by targeting the cancer from several angles, targeting six different antigens expressed by the disease, versus the targeting of one antigen by other immunotherapies (i.e. Provenge).</p><p>Now at Lion, one of Singh's top priorities is to take its product, TILs (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes), and combine it with anti-PD-1s. Already in a Phase 2 study on patients with the severest and most deadly form of melanoma, TILs produced a 22% complete response, and 19 of the 20 patients who <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/lion-biotechnologies-provides-phase-ii-120000866.html"">achieved a complete response</a> are still alive 6-9 years later. In a study of 136 patients treated at NCI, MD Anderson and other top institutions, TILs <a href=""http://www.genesis-biopharma.com/?page_id=8"">produced</a> a 50% objective response, which is far better than any other FDA approved late-stage melanoma treatment, a second and third line salvage setting where all other treatments had failed.</p><p>While the Phase 2 data was very good, Singh now looks to test TILs with anti-PD-1s and other therapeutics such as Zelboraf. According to <a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01585415"">clinicaltrials.gov,</a> the Phase 1 study for TILs and Zelboraf is actively recruiting patients. Zelboraf is a highly effective treatment for melanoma patients who have a BRAF mutation, but unfortunately, patients often recur within 9 months of treatment. Thus, by combining two different treatment approaches (TILs and Zelboraf) it is possible to keep those patients in a disease free state for longer periods of time. It is this thought process of using different therapeutic approaches that Bristol-Myers, Merck, AstraZeneca, and even small companies such as Lion are attempting to perfect.</p><p>In regards to anti-PD-1s and TILs, this could be a highly effective combination. Most tumor types have a small number of T-cells known as Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes or &quot;TILs&quot;. These TILs fight the disease but are not strong enough alone because it's insufficient in quantity and because of T-Cell suppression by the tumor via PD-1 pathways. Hence, Lion already solved the first problem by making TILs more potent and increasing the number from a few million to several billion cells before injecting into the patient, which has worked well in clinical trials. But, with anti-PD-1s, TILs might work even better as the immune system better recognizes the disease. As I previously stated, the same concept applies to all companies that are trying to use anti-PD-1s with other therapeutics, essentially attacking the disease from several angles.</p><p>At $3.55 Lion has a market cap of just $65 million. While there are risks associated with such a small company, Singh recently <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/lion-biotechnologies-completes-23-3-130000823.html"">completed a private financing</a> that gave the company net proceeds of $21.6 million. Thus giving Lion more than two years worth of operating cash. Also, the company's data is robust, having treated 136 patients at four well respected sites. In fact, such data is far superior to what we've seen among competing companies in treating cancer, those that have higher market caps, including Singh's previous company ImmunoCellular Therapeutics with just 16 patients. While there are no guarantees that Singh's company can replicate its clinical data in an even larger study, investors have to like the combined effect of a larger number of strong T-cells and anti-PD-1s, both of which have shown consistent response rates in the 30%-50% range.</p><p><a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1724862-investing-smart-biotechs-effective-therapies-and-shareholder-friendly-ceos"">Click here</a> for my detailed assessment of Lion's Phase 2 data</p><p><b>Where is the Investment Upside?</b></p><p>If we look through biotechnology as a focus, it really is remarkable to identify which areas or stocks are gaining the most momentum with investors. Of those known as battleground stocks, or momentum stocks, we can identify Alexion Pharmaceuticals, BioMarin, Regeneron, Celgene, Gilead, Biogen, Valeant, Pharmacyclics, and Vertex. These are the companies that have performed the best over a course of years and have become most popular in the healthcare space, in some ways replacing conventional names such as Bristol-Myers, Pfizer, Merck, or Eli Lilly.</p><p>However, investors should consider the diseases being treated by these noted companies. Alexion and BioMarin are both orphan companies. Regeneron's biggest programs lie in treating diseases of the eye, asthma, and cholesterol. Gilead is known for its HIV and hepatitis product-line. Biogen is known for its multiple sclerosis pipeline; Valeant is an acquisitive company with good growth in several industries; and Vertex has rallied in response to its HCV and cystic fibrosis platform. Therefore, all of these companies have a niche, and only Celgene and Pharmacyclics are known for significant product innovations in the treatment of cancer.</p><p>While some may view the lack of development on behalf of biotech's elite as a bad sign for oncology, this fact might be good for big pharma. Companies such as Merck, Bristol-Myers, Roche, AstraZeneca and then smaller companies such as Lion, have an opportunity to control a space that is much larger than anything being developed by the industry's elite. Thus, when I say a paradigm shift, we are not only seeing survival increase from months to years, but also in the way the market views companies developing such therapeutics. In the past, with very little progress and innovation being made, there was no reason to get too excited about new therapeutics. Today, there is real reason to be excited, and this could lead to a shift in which companies the market rewards with large valuation premiums, those such as Merck and possibly Lion at some point in the future.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[IMUC]], [[MRK]], [[LBIO]].

"1201001","2013-02-18 14:16:05","Stocks Could Rise For Companies Investing In Immunotherapy Treatments","<p>Immunotherapy, also called biologic therapy or biotherapy, utilizes the body's immune system to fight diseases such as cancer. A number of biopharmaceutical companies, large and small, are developing targeted immunotherapies to stimulate the body's immune system to work harder and smarter, with the goal to destroy certain cancers. Below are three companies, of various sizes and stages of development, that have developed, or are developing, some of the most advanced immunotherapies today in the fight against cancer.</p><p>As expected <strong>Celgene (CELG),</strong> on February 8th, received <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm338895.htm"">approval</a>, from the FDA, for its new immunomodulatory drug Pomalidomide, designed to treat multiple myeloma when Celgene's own drug Revlimid or Takeda Pharmaceuticals' Velcade have failed. Marketed under the name Pomalyst, the drug is taken in pill form, and is designed to bolster the body's immune system to destroy cancerous cells and inhibit cancer cell growth. Multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer that originates from plasma cells in the bone marrow, generally affects older adults. Globally, approximately 1,000 new cases of <a href=""http://myeloma.org/ArticlePage.action?articleId=1560"">multiple myeloma</a> are diagnosed every day. In the U.S, there are roughly 75,000 to 100,000 multiple myeloma suffers. The median survival rate is three to five years following a diagnosis.</p><p>The approval of Pomalyst should be an excellent addition to Celgene's successful line of myeloma drugs. Revlimid, the company's flagship and highly successful multiple myeloma drug, accounts for almost 66% of the company's revenues. In 2012 sales of the drug were roughly $4.2 billion. However, 66% is a high percentage for one drug for a company the size of Celgene to rely on, especially when its next highest percentage drug, Vidaza, with sales in 2012 of $838 million, accounts for roughly 15% of the company's revenues. Also to be considered is that sales of Vidaza could drop, as it went off patent in the U.S. in May 2011. Add to that, sales of Revlimid could find some competition from <strong>Onyx Pharmaceutical's (ONXX)</strong> multiple myeloma drug <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm312920.htm"">Kyprolis</a>, which was granted FDA approval earlier in 2012. Revlimid is projected to grow 9% to 12% over the next year. Sales of Pomalyst, which in a <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-11/celgene-s-pomalidomide-helps-in-myeloma-after-others-fail.html"">Bloomberg</a> report sees annual sales could climb to $1 billion by 2017, could not only offset revenues from lost sales to Kyprolis, but it could lower that high percentage of sales that the company relies on with Revlimid.</p><p>CELG, which has a market cap of $41.8 billion, has seen its stock rise 25.8% YTD. The company generates strong cash flow, and is expected to grow 20% compounded per year, and projects to see revenue climb to <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-true-effect-positive-findings-research-report-on-celgene-corporation-and-gilead-sciences-inc-2013-01-23"">$12 billion</a> a year by 2017. Additionally, the company has high hopes for its new drug Apremilast, for the treatment of Psoriasis. CLGN is expected to file a New Drug Application for Apremilast with the FDA and the EU in the first quarter of 2013. <a href=""http://www.psoriasis.org/learn_statistics"">Psoriasis</a>, an autoimmune disease, affects 125 million people worldwide, and care costs are approximately $11.25 billion annually, though work loss accounts for 40% of the costs.</p><p>The question is, will Celgene continue it strong growth in 2013? Though I don't expect the stock to double, as it almost did over the past year from its lows in late June of 2012, I do believe, with the products it has on the market and the pipeline of new drugs in late stage tests, the stock has plenty of growth over the next few years. Celgene has eased off its Feb 1st high of $102.23 per share; on Friday February 15th the stock closed at $98.77. Though not a bargain price, I think if the pullback continues Celgene becomes an even stronger buy.</p><p>A small company out of San Diego, CA, <strong>Vical (VICL)</strong> is developing a promising immunotherapy drug, <a href=""http://www.vical.com/products/cancer-immunotherapies/allovectin/default.aspx"">Allovectin</a>, for late stage melanoma. Allovectin, which is being evaluated in phase III testing, is a plasmid based DNA therapy expressing two genes (HLA-B7 and &beta;2 microglobulin) that together form an MHC class 1 complex. Allovectin is injected directly into the melanoma cancer tumor via syringe, and is designed to teach the body's immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells through an allogeneic anti-tumor response. The drug also restores tumor-associated antigen presentation, and gives a boost to the immune response through a lipid/DNA-induced danger signal.</p><p>Allovectin may have some advantages over another targeted immunotherapy drug that has shown success in battling late stage melanoma, <strong>Bristol Myers Squibb's (BMY),</strong> Yervoy. Unlike <a href=""http://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/3-events-biotech-investors-need-to-watch-in-2013-vical-incorporated-vicl-and-more-63458/"">Yervoy</a>, which must be administered via infusion and requires monitoring following the treatment, Allovectin can be given in an outpatient basis requiring little monitoring afterwards. Also, in the phase II study no patients who took Allovectin experienced severe adverse side effects that sometimes occurred with patients taking Yervoy. Yervoy, the first new drug in over 14 years to be approved for Melanoma, generated <a href=""http://www.zacks.com/ZER/rd_get_pdf.php?r=BMY"">sales</a> in 2012 of $706 million, up 96% over 2011, and annual sales are forecasted to rise to over $1 billion by 2021. It is estimated that the branded melanoma market in the U.S. and the EU markets will increase from $1.1 billion in 2012 to just under $2.4 billion by 2021.</p><p>Vical, which earlier obtained <a href=""http://www.vical.com/products/cancer-immunotherapies/default.aspx"">Orphan Drug</a> and Fast Track designations in the U.S. for Allovectin, expects to announce phase III results mid-2013. If successful with the trials, and given that the drug is not melanoma-specific, Allovectin has the potential to be used in treating other types of solid tumors including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and head and neck cancer. Vical is taking a business smart approach with its products; the company knows its strong points are R&amp;D, so it is seeking commercialization partners for Allovectin in the major markets including the U.S. and Europe. Vical has already received $22.6 million from AnGes MG, Inc., for the <a href=""http://www.vical.com/investors/news-releases/News-Release-Details/2008/Vical-Receives-Payment-from-AnGes-MG-for-Allovectin-7supsup-Phase-3-Pivotal-Trial/default.aspx"">licensing rights</a> to commercialize Allovectin in Japan and other specified Asian countries. AnGes MG is primarily interested in developing the drug as a treatment for head and neck cancer, which presents a significant unmet medical need in Asia.</p><p>Vical, which has a market cap of $289 million, has seen its stock rise over 15% year to date, primarily due to positive comments on the Allovectin trial. The stock closed Friday, January 15th at $3.38 per share. What I like about Vical is the company is not a one product house; it has several therapies in various stages of development, including <a href=""http://www.vical.com/products/infectious-disease-vaccines/transVax/default.aspx"">TransVax,</a> a first-in-class DNA vaccine, which is in phase III trials for hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. In the first half of 2013 the company will begin a phase II trial of TransVax for solid organ transplant recipients. In a deal that will give Vical up to $130 million in total upfront and milestone payments the company has already licensed TransVax to <strong>Astellas Pharma Inc. (ALPMF),</strong> granting Astellas an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize TransVax.</p><p>Vical has approximately $86 million in <a href=""http://www.4-traders.com/VICAL-INCORPORATED-11283/news/Vical-Incorporated-Vical-Reports-2012-Financial-Results-and-Progress-in-Key-Development-Programs-16013290/"">cash and investments</a>, and the company is projecting net cash burn for the first half of 2013, excluding cash from financing activities, of between $18 million and $20 million. <a href=""http://www.vical.com/investors/news-releases/News-Release-Details/2013/Vical-Reports-2012-Financial-Results-and-Progress-in-Key-Development-Programs1133414/default.aspx"">Revenues</a> for 2012 were $17.5 million, down 41.7% YTD due to lower payments from Astellas. The company showed a net loss of $0.27 per share, almost three times greater than in 2011. However, this is a research and development company on the forefront of gene based immunotherapy, and the company should not be evaluated on its current sales alone; its pipeline what could become a billion dollar drug therapy. If the news on Allovectin continues to be positive I can see Vical breaking new highs, and though I still see the stock has its risks, I think the stock has a strong potential for gains this year.</p><p>While I am long on Vical and its drug Allovectin there is another company in its early stages of developing a similar DNA plasmid based melanoma treatment, except it has what might be a superior method of administering its medicine directly into the tumors. The company is called <strong>OncoSec Medical (ONCS.OB)</strong>, and the therapy is called <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-technologies/immunopulse/"">ImmunoPulse</a>. Like Allovectin, ImmunoPulse utilizes a DNA plasmid to help the body's immune system to seek out and destroy cancer cells, in ONCS's case - the ones coerced to express the <a href=""http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/vgxi-to-manufacture-gmp-il-12-plasmid-for-oncosec-s-electroimmunotherapy-trials/81246853/"">interleukin-12</a> (IL-12) protein. And like Allovectin, the treatment is injected directly to the tumor site. However, that's where the comparison ends. ImmunoPulse then utilizes the propriety OncoSec Medical System (OMS), which is an electroporation platform. Once the plasmid is injected intratumorally, six needles, hooked up to a generator, are inserted into the skin around the tumor; it is then given short pulses of <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Melanoma-treatment-shows-promise-at-UCSF-3714590.php"">1,300 volts</a>. The electric field causes the pores of the melanoma cells' membranes to open, thus delivering the DNA medicine directly into the open pores. The electric field is turned off, the cells' pores close, and the plasmid DNA is trapped inside the tumor cells for a more effective treatment. The treated cells begin expressing IL-12, which in turn triggers an immune response against those cells with that expression.</p><p>The benefits of the OMS appear to reach father than previously expected. Not only is the agent trapped inside the cancer cells themselves that causes a local response against the electroporated tumors, but also the process has shown to affect a much larger area than just the cells targeted by the OMS. Researchers have found that the patients' immune systems were attacking cancer cells that were outside the direct treatment areas, including distant lesions. ONCS has been pleased with the positive interim results of its ImmunoPulse phase II trial for metastatic melanoma that has supported the key findings from the phase I trial. This interim data indicates that ImmunoPulse is able to induce regression or stabilization of local and distant untreated metastases following a single cycle of treatment.</p><p>ONCS has a second electroporation based therapy, NeoPulse, which uses a chemotherapeutic based drug, bleomycin. NeoPulse has been evaluated in two <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oms/"">phase III trials</a> in Europe for skin cancer and for head and neck cancer, and is planning to advance to the registration trial. In an earlier interview with ONCS CEO <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/896721-interview-with-oncosec-ceo-punit-dhillon"">Punit Dhillon</a>, he commented on the future of NeoStem:</p><blockquote class=""quote""><p>Our focus for the NeoPulse program is to present the data to a number of specifically targeted potential partners for their evaluation as a license opportunity. If we can land a partner for this program, which we see as a near-term commercial opportunity, then we feel that this would be a significant validation of our data and the NeoPulse program.</p></blockquote><p>Finding a partner for NeoPulse could be a significant move for ONCS, first it could bring in some much needed cash to help sustain the company, secondly, as Mr. Dhillon commented the company has &quot;<em>only so many resources</em>,&quot; and he wants his company to focus its efforts on ImmunoPulse.</p><p>ONCS is a nano cap company; it has a market cap just over $19 million, and closed on Friday, January 15th at $0.20 per share. I think the stock is selling below value. I came to this conclusion for a number of reasons: the positive data from the trials for both ImmunoPulse and NeoPulse; last year both ImmunoPulse and NeoPulse received the <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-receives-ce-mark-for-its-electroporation-device"">CE mark</a> for use in the European Economic Area; there are more than 2 million cases of skin cancer diagnosed in the U.S. each year; and, as noted earlier, the projected melanoma market in the US and the EU could reach just under $2.4 billion by 2021. For those reasons alone I believe that ONCS may well be an undervalued stock, and although investing in any nano cap development company carries a high risk I am long on ONCS.</p><p>Immunotherapy is still a new approach for the treatment of cancer, but trials have thus far indicated that it is clearly a viable form of treatment, and as more Immunotherapies continue to be researched, tested and come to market, companies who have developed these treatments should see great financial rewards. I like Celgene as a safe and solid investment for the future. However, for a more risky investment that has the potential for higher rewards I would look at Vical or OncoSec Medical.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[VICL]], [[ONCS.OB]].

"856401","2012-09-10 07:42:06","3 Companies With Exciting Phase II Trial Data Close Out 2012","<p>Although there are some that <a href=""http://www.thelifesciencesreport.com/pub/na/13973"">may not agree</a>, it is the author's opinion that positive <span><span></span>Phase II trial data is typically a bigger share price mover than either successful <span><span></span>Phase III data or regulatory approvals. For example, Peregrine Pharmaceuticals' (PPHM) recent interim <a href=""http://ir.peregrineinc.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=705521"">data unveiling</a> of its <span><span></span>Phase II trial of bavituximab for second-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is likely the highlight of the company's existence. The apparently successful trial epitomizes the type of gains seen in early-stage pharmaceuticals for the fortunate shareholders who were lucky enough or wise enough to be part of the phenomenal run up in the company's share price. Peregrine had already released interim data on March 9<span> of this year for a different trial in which the drug was used for the <a href=""http://ir.peregrineinc.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=655805"">treatment of front-line NSCLC</a>. Unexpectedly long progression free survival in the control arm that was treated with commonly prescribed carboplatin and paclitaxel caused concern for shareholders with bavituximab only offering a 1.2 month benefit. Shareholders reacted by selling off from the day's closing $0.90 to an April 25 52-week low of $0.39. The May 21release of interim data for <a href=""http://ir.peregrineinc.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=675168"">second-line NSCLC</a> gave shareholders hope with a doubling of overall response rate versus the control arm with roughly a 50% increase in progression free survival. However, shareholder response was remarkably muted with share price increasing from $0.40 at data release to $0.58 three days later for a 45% gain - impressive but well under the 52-week high of $5.08 experienced less than four months later for comparable results from the same trial.</p><p>For those missing out of the remarkable run of over 1200% in just a few short months, there is still money to be made in PPHM. However, the now $470 million market capitalization company doesn't present the value that it did earlier in the year when it was well under $50 million. Peregrine still has more catalysts upcoming with additional Bavituximab data to be presented for its front-line and second-line NSCLC and another <span><span></span>Phase II trial with interim data expected before year-end for pancreatic cancer using the same drug. However, gains from current levels would likely be less as the author advises potential new shareholders to adopt the &quot;watch and wait&quot; approach to ascertain where the new support levels will end up being. Also to be taken into consideration, in the company's recently-filed <a href=""http://ir.peregrineinc.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1019687-12-2424%26CIK=704562"">annual report</a> was the statement &quot;<em>Based on our current projections, which include projected revenues under signed contracts with existing customers of Avid, and assuming we do not generate any additional revenues or raise any additional capital from the capital markets or other potential sources, we believe we have sufficient cash on hand combined with amounts expected to be received from Avid customers to meet our obligations as they become due through at least the third quarter of our fiscal year 2013 ending January 31, 2013</em>&quot;. Although the dollar amount is unknown, the company seems poised to under some sort of financing in the coming weeks.</p><p>Bavituximab may or may not have a promising future ahead of it depending on how the <span><span></span>Phase II trials and subsequent <span><span></span>Phase III trials pan out. However, investors have made their gains and many may begin their exodus either in part or in full in anticipation of lower share price reentry or moving into other promising companies with exciting new therapies in their pipelines, whether early stage or not. PPHM's year reemphasizes the importance of early-stage entry for maximum gains, although other gains are most likely coming for the company's common stock. However, there are three companies with <span><span></span>Phase II trials already well underway with each providing a wealth of possibilities. Following are summaries of the companies proposed that may offer large gains due to currently-suppressed share price, much like PPHM was earlier in the year. Although another 1200% gainer is improbable, huge gains can be made nonetheless. Downside possibilities exist; so potential shareholders are advised to perform their own risk assessment to weigh upside potential versus downside risk.</p><p><strong>Catalyst Pharmaceutical Partners (CPRX)</strong> leads off Q4 2012 with <span><span></span>Phase II results due out for its lead drug candidate, CPP-109 (vigabatrin), for cocaine addiction. The data is actually due out per the company's <a href=""http://ir.catalystpharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=691302"">revised schedule</a> &quot;around the end of September 2012&quot; versus the previous projection of Q1 2013. Per the press release &quot;<em>After discussions with our collaborators, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program (VACSP), and our statistical and regulatory consultants, we have been able to work through the complexities of modifying our statistical analysis plan. This will enable us to report top-line trial results about four months earlier than previously expected</em>.&quot; Whether this can be construed as positive data to be expected is anybody's guess. However, time is money and earlier completion of the trial and data presentation is money saved for the company and its shareholders. The trial received a &quot;Fast Track&quot; status from the FDA, which can help speed up the regulatory process. The <span><span></span>Phase II trial is short for the small pharma world requiring only 24-weeks total for the patient set. The actual treatment phase of the trial is comprised of nine weeks. Clinical investigators are scheduled to evaluate patients at weeks 8-9 to determine how many patients abstain from cocaine use versus the group receiving a placebo.</p><p>Earlier trials of CPP-109 for cocaine dependence do point to possible positive data coming from the upcoming <span><span></span>Phase II trial. A <a href=""http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/data/Journals/AJP/3905/09aj1269.PDF"">data set</a> presented in a 2009 American Journal of Psychiatry publication titled <span>&quot;Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Vigabatrin for the Treatment of Cocaine Dependence in Mexican Parolees&quot;</span> concluded that the 46 patient arm of the trial receiving CPP-109 that made it through completion of the trial had full abstinence in 14 patients, or 30%. The placebo arm of the trial had 48 patients with only 4, or 8%, of the patient set exhibiting full abstinence. The correlation of CPP-109's effectiveness appears to be unquestionable with this data set. However, shareholders should take into consideration that the trial was not tightly controlled due to the nature of the trial's surroundings and administration as stated on page 7 of the study. Nonetheless, with about 699,000 patients receiving treatment for cocaine abuse in 2010, the unmet need and marketing potential are huge with near-blockbuster potential for this indication only, not to mention the other indications under evaluation including opiate, alcohol and methamphetamine dependence.</p><p>With the company announcing data presentation &quot;around the end of September&quot;, interest should increase rapidly in the coming days. However, the company's recent press release stating that it would present at the upcoming Rodman and Renshaw global investment conference may provide just such a venue for the data presentation. According to the <a href=""http://www.meetmax.com/sched/event_12473/%7epublic/h/list_presentations_print.html?event_id=12473"">conference website</a>, CPRX is scheduled to present at 12:05 EST on Monday, September the 10th. Whether or not the company chooses to present this critical data at such a venue is up in the air. However, interest should begin waxing in the very near future starting with at least a mention of the upcoming data from Catalyst Pharmaceutical CEO, Patrick McEnany at Rodman and Renshaw. With a current market capitalization of about $42 million, significant upside could occur with the right news for this small pharma.</p><p><strong>OncoSec Medical (ONCS.OB)</strong> has had a tumultuous year as evident from the company's 2012 stock chart. <span>January 1 opening price was </span>$0.25, and the stock touched $0.75 numerous times in February before returning back to earth in mid-March where <span>it </span>has traded in the $0.15 to $0.25 range pretty much every since. The company's novel electroporation platform for cancer treatment has far-reaching implications as it is showing early stage success. Two <span><span></span>Phase III trials of OncoSec's NeoPulse<span><span></span> therapy (using bleomycin as its chemotherapy agent of choice) for head and neck cancer trial were already complete when the company licensed the platform from Inovio Pharmaceuticals (INO) in March of 2011. However, the company probably didn't purchase the license due to these trials as it had been discontinued in 2007 after an independent data monitoring committee review citing efficacy and safety concerns. A <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-oms-electrochemotherapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-shows-enhanced-quality-of-life-in-two-randomized-phase-iii-studies"">subsequent data reevaluation</a> by OncoSec as presented on July 23<span> yielded different results with CEO and president, Punit Dhillon, noting <em>&quot;Interim analysis of these two Phase III studies, and the recently released data from the Phase IV study carried out in Europe, has demonstrated that the primary endpoint of maintaining quality of life was achieved. In addition, OMS ElectroChemotherapy appears to provide a potentially important treatment alternative to surgery that may address hard-to-treat tumors where there exists a particular need to preserve function and quality of life. These data strongly support our partnering efforts for the OMS ElectroChemotherapy program.&quot;</em></p><p>Although the presentation garnered a lot of shareholder attention as evident by the 7.29 million shares of the company's common stock that traded hands on that Monday, the company closed in the red to the dismay of many. The author believes that the reevaluation, although likely legitimate, will need to be evaluated by an independent third party entity in order to truly gain shareholder support. The company is currently evaluating its options as to the best regulatory path forward, and additional catalysts via these decisions are likely in the coming weeks. Trading in the low $0.20's with a market capitalization of only $18 million, investors seem to have priced in failure for the <span>Phase III trial already which could be to the benefit of new shareholders as the downside risk certainly seems heavily outweighed by the upside potential.</p><p>Pertinent to the scope of the article, OncoSec currently has <span><a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/clinical/"">three <span>Phase II trials underway</a></span> with two of them set to release interim data in Q4, 2012. These trials, although still utilizing an electroporation administration platform, are being utilized to evaluate the company's ImmunoPulse<span> platform with an IL-12 DNA construct as its immunotherapy agent of choice rather than a chemotherapy agent. Once inside the targeted cancer cells, the construct instructs the cell to produce the IL-12 cytokine. This induces an immune response from the patient's body, which targets and destroys the IL-12 expressed cells via circulating macrophages and cytotoxic T-cells. The company should be presenting <span>Phase II data from its metastatic melanoma (the largest market targeted) and Merkel cell carcinoma trials by the end of the year, either of which could be huge share price movers. Success in these trials would be huge as not only would it indicate success going forward for these indications, but it could also help to validate the company's entire OMS platform and open the door for other indications using IL-12 and other interleukin DNA constructs. Like PPHM earlier in the year, OncoSec is trading at consolidation levels in the low levels and could see similar gains with <span><span></span>Phase II trial success. This could particularly be true if the metastatic melanoma trial indicates early stage success, as the market potential is great with over 70,000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed annually with it being the deadliest of the skin cancers.</p><p>Earlier <a href=""http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/26/36/5896.full"">dose-escalated <span>Phase I data</a> indicated that the ImmunoPulse administration of the IL-12 DNA construct was safe and well tolerated. In patients with metastatic melanoma, 52% of patients treated had either complete or partial responses. If <span><span></span>Phase II data, which is based on trials with optimal levels of IL-12 as determined by the <span><span></span>Phase I trial, yield comparable or better results, shareholder value should become evident quickly. Like CPRX, OncoSec is also <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-to-present-at-the-rodman-renshaw-2012-annual-global-investment-conference/"">presenting at Rodman and Renshaw</a> on Monday, September 10th (at 3:15 pm). Although data from either of the phase two trials is unlikely, the company may be better able to give shareholders an idea of exactly when the data might become available. Additionally, the company may be able to shed additional light on the data reevaluation of its two completed <span><span></span>Phase III trials for head and neck cancer. A clear regulatory path forward, third party data review or partnership going forward could also be huge catalysts for this fledgling biotech. As mentioned, <span><span></span>Phase III failure seems to have been already priced in, so downside risk is minimal but still exists. The bigger catalysts, either upward or downward, rests in the two <span><span></span>Phase II trial data presentations sets to be unveiled in Q4.</p><p><strong>Zalicius, Inc. (ZLCS)</strong> is slated to present topline data for its <a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=148036%26p=irol-newsArticle%26ID=1688823%26highlight=""><span><span></span>Phase II<span>b</span> SYNERGY trial of Synavive</a><span><span></span> for amplified immuno-inflammatory benefits in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in 3Q. At the time of publication of this article, data is still pending for this large market indication therapy. With a 52-week range of $0.71 to $1.62, the upside potential could still be great for this small cap pharma currently valued at $176 million. Recent financing secured the company another $75 million, which should minimize the risk of additional dilution for new shareholders through the next year while the company irons out its finances and further develops its promising pipeline. Synavive<span><span></span><span>'s <span>Phase IIa</span> data was promising with statistically significant efficacy of DAS28 and ACR20 (measurements of disease activity and change over time in such activity scores, respectively) relative to a placebo.</p><p>Like many small capitalization pharmaceuticals, even those which are at least partly generating revenue with marketed products, Zalicus' true value does not lie in its current financials but rather in its potential growth due to a promising and <a href=""http://www.zalicus.com/product-pipeline/pipeline-overview.asp"">growing pipeline</a>. The rheumatoid arthritis indication is a huge market potential with up to 1% of the U.S. population being affected. Synavive<span><span></span>'s mechanism is unique by enhancing the anti-inflammatory benefits of glucocorticoids (steroids) without the associated dose-dependent side effects. Success in this <span><span></span>Phase II<span>b</span> trial is significant not only due to the immediate ramifications of a large market potential indication of rheumatoid arthritis, but it also could also legitimize the drug for many indications in which glucocorticoids are commonly prescribed such as Crohn's disease, lupus, bursitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma or any of many conditions in which these steroids may be part of the long-term treatment regimen.</p><p>Presented are three small capitalization pharmaceuticals with significant <span><span></span>Phase II catalysts scheduled in late 3Q and 4Q 2012. There is obviously upside potential and downside risks in each of these companies due to their financials and upcoming data. Shareholders are advised to perform additional research to determine which, if any, positions are suitable for their portfolios. Peregrine pharmaceuticals should be commended for their success in second-line NSCLC and its upcoming additional successes. Bavituximab's approval is still not set in stone, as there are additional trials and regulatory barriers coming. However, it is giving the healthcare sector and patients hope for its difficult-to-treat targeted indication. CPRX, ONCS.OB and ZLCS could each offer shareholders, the healthcare sector and most importantly patients hope with their <span><span></span>Phase II data coming in the waning days of 2012. Rodman and Renshaw presentations may catalyze CPRX and ONCS.OB on Monday, while ZLCS can also present data via a press release anytime between now and the end of September.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[CPRX]].

"884101","2012-09-24 09:48:35","The Promising, Cheap, And Growing Cell Therapy Arena Continues To Outperform The Market","<p>In the last three months, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied more than 7% following progress in the housing market and the assurance of quantitative easing in a slow recovery. The market is trading near multi-year highs with strong performance across the board, and one of the best performing under-the-radar industries has been cell therapy. While the market trades higher due to indicators that suggest a safer economy, the cell therapy arena has been affected by strong clinical data and a renewal of support among global economies. In the past, cell therapy was viewed as a false hope, a fairy tale, or something that could never be supported as an approved treatment. But after years of research and discovery, along with the evolution of biotechnology, this is a space that is growing and expanding rapidly.</p><p>Last Wednesday, a <a href=""http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/274623/economy/business/stem-cell-therapy-to-lead-dots-proposed-medical-tourism-plan"">plan</a> from the Department of Tourism in the Philippines made its way throughout social media sites discussing &quot;medical tourism.&quot; The proposed plan aims to have the medical sector put its best foot forward and highlight stem cell therapies as the next generation of treatment in many areas of specialization. This is yet another win for the industry, one that continues to grow in support and value. Over the years, we have seen as various countries turn their focus to stem cell therapies, by promoting their benefits and investing in their research. And as a result, with increased support and funding, stem cell therapy companies have increased in value to a large degree. To better explain, I suggest taking a look at a few of these companies that are leading in performance and are partially responsible for this new-found level of support and excitement.</p><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""0""><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup> <tr><td><p><strong>Company</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Ticker</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Market Cap (millions)</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>2012 Performance</strong></p></td></tr> <tr><td><p>Osiris Therapeutics</p></td><td><p>(OSIR)</p></td><td><p>$313.5</p></td><td><p>79%</p></td></tr> <tr><td><p>Pluristem</p></td><td><p>(PSTI)</p></td><td><p>$200</p></td><td><p>70%</p></td></tr> <tr><td><p>NeoStem</p></td><td><p>(NBS)</p></td><td><p>$110</p></td><td><p>45%</p></td></tr> <tr><td><p>Neuralstem</p></td><td><p>(CUR)</p></td><td><p>$71</p></td><td><p>35%</p></td></tr> <tr><td><p>StemCells</p></td><td><p>(STEM)</p></td><td><p>$64</p></td><td><p>160%</p></td></tr></table><p>In the chart above, you can identify the market leaders in the cell therapy arena. Please note the market capitalization of these companies. Each is a small cap stock and a reflection of the industry. It is a new industry, one with great promise, but still in its early stages. Therefore, stocks are cheap, valuations are attractive, and performance is appealing. This is a good indication of the current state of cell therapy: promising, cheap, and growing. However, it is also volatile, as investors and consumers slowly begin to accept the benefits and explore the possibilities of the space. With that being said, let's take a look at the leaders mentioned to discuss how each company is instrumental in the development of this fast-growing space.</p><p><em><strong>Osiris Therapeutics</strong></em> is the largest company presented, and has grown the most in terms of valuation throughout 2012, adding more than $140 million to its market capitalization in this year alone. Osiris is the first and only company to have an approved product with a cell therapy as the main component, a major breakthrough. Since it has been awarded an approval in both Canada and in New Zealand in 2012, the company is well deserving of its growing valuation, and is a crucial company to the future of cell therapy. Osiris proves that various regulators are accepting of the concept and benefits of cell therapy, and this achievement paves a road for the companies that are seeking regulatory approval in the years that lie ahead. Earlier this year, in June, the company's valuation increased to more than $450 million following the <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/OSIR.O/key-developments/article/2557417"">second approval</a> of its cell therapy, Prochymal, in New Zealand, but share price has since fallen and stabilized. The company now seeks additional indications for Prochymal; but regardless of whether or not Prochymal is awarded additional uses, the company remains the current face of cell therapy.</p><p><em><strong>Pluristem Therapeutics</strong></em> is a company that has come to the forefront of cell therapy over the last year with a slew of key developments for its product line. The company's gains have all occurred during the last three <span>months (81%), </span>as <span>they have for </span>most of the companies in this space. The stock has been driven higher in anticipation of its Phase II<span> trial for the treatment of the fast-growing disease, Peripheral Arterial Disease. The company has taken additional measures to ensure the success of its clinical studies by <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/PSTI.O/key-developments/article/2574839"">partnering</a> with CPC Clinical Research for services related to enrolling and sustaining clinical sites; the company has also announced a new <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/PSTI.O/key-developments/article/2589986"">collaboration</a> with Cato Research as its contract research organization in Germany. The company recently announced a public offering which pushed shares lower, but is now recovering with the support and the abundance of investors who are optimistic regarding this company's future and its PLX cells.</span></p><p><em><strong>NeoStem</strong></em> has performed well in 2012, is a good representative of the space, and is <span>probably the</span> value play of the industry. The company is a perfect example of how timing is everything for a biotechnology company during a period of financing. Pluristem announced a <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/news/neostem-announces-proposed-public-offering-of-common-stock-and-warrants.html""><span>public offering</span></a> and lost 10% of its value last year while the market was trading lower. Meanwhile NeoStem lost half of its valuation following a period of <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/news/neostem-announces-proposed-public-offering-of-common-stock-and-warrants.html"">financing in March</a> of this year, and the company's shares have been in recovery mode since then. NeoStem is probably the most diversified play in the cell therapy space. The company has a Phase <span>II</span> product, AMR-001, which is continuing as planned after a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) noted no safety <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/news/neostem-reports-data-safety-monitoring-board-recommends-continuation-of-preserve-ami-phase-2-trial-neostem-reports-data-safety-monitoring-board-recommends-continuation-of-preserve-ami-phase-2-trial.html"">concerns</a> for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, a largely unmet medical need. The AMR-001 trial is closely watched among cell therapy followers due to the potential revenue of treating this large indication. Along with additional hope through the company's early stage <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/clinical-development/vsel.html"">VSEL program</a>, it also has a <a href=""http://pctcelltherapy.com/"">manufacturing segment</a> with 65,000 square feet of development and manufacturing space that serve its many clients. Its manufacturing space is a fast-growing segment that involves several big name clients and innovative products in which NeoStem is poised to benefit following any approvals. It's a complex business, but large and adds to the company's stability due to the diversity of its presence within the industry. The company recently <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-06-18/neostem-selling-stake-in-chinese-generic-drugmaker"">divested</a> its generic Chinese pharmacy. The sale provided the company with $12.3 million in cash and eliminated $35 million in short and long-term debt obligations, thus making NeoStem a healthier company along with being safe, diversified, and full of upside potential.</p><p><em><strong>Neuralstem</strong></em> and <em><strong>StemCells</strong></em> are the final two companies to discuss as both have appreciated nicely. Neuralstem has traded higher by an incredible 150% during the last month once the company's NSI-566 showed that paralyzed rats <a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/neuralstem-cells-induce-significant-functional-improvement-in-permanent-rat-spinal-cord-injury-cell-study-reports-169635546.html"">regained</a> some motor function after being treated with the company's stem cells. This created interest among investors who believed the company's stem cells could be a breakthrough in human trials, and for the industry as a whole. However, I am a bit more skeptical of the move until more data is presented, as this is an early-stage development (<span>preclinical),</span> but the data does serve to validate the sector's work additionally. It is, however, worth watching and could add even more excitement to the space if proven effective. On the other hand, StemCells' 160% YTD performance is the clear leader due to its <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/STEM.O/key-developments"">preclinical data</a> in patients with Alzheimer's. In a preclinical study, StemCells demonstrated that its human neural stem cells restored memory and enhanced synaptic function in two animal models relevant to Alzheimer's disease. However, much like Neuralstem, the data is still early stage and must be further explored; but if efficient in large human studies, it could indicate a huge win for the future of cell therapy and the company itself.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Each of the companies above has contributed to the excitement that surrounds cell therapy. In the past, there was little research into the possibilities of using stem cells derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or from the umbilical cord to treat and cure degenerative diseases. But now we have seen data and have various studies that suggest significant upside in the future of this space, and these companies are among the first to explore its many benefits. Therefore, with so much upside it makes sense that organizations from both the public and private sector would <a href=""http://stemcellassays.com/2012/08/perspectives-investing-regenerative-medicine-results-termis-survey/"">continue to invest</a> in future growth. With more energy being spent on the development of therapies, and the various countries that are electing to invest in their success, this is a space that is not only promising, cheap, and growing, but also very attractive as an investment with large upside potential in the coming weeks, months, and years.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[NBS]], [[OSIR]].

"1220021","2013-02-25 02:43:00","Diagnosis And Treatment Of Disease With Radiotherapies May Prove Profitable In 2013","<p>Nuclear medicine uses small amounts of radioactive isotopes to diagnose and/or treat diseases such as cancer and heart disease, while also providing doctors with information about both structure and function within the body. Using radioisotope diagnostics, a doctor can gather medical information that would otherwise be unavailable, require surgery, or necessitate more expensive diagnostic tests. These imaging procedures often identify abnormalities very early in the progress of a disease - long before many medical problems are apparent via other diagnostic procedures. Radioisotopes used therapeutically are &quot;tried and true&quot;, with primary uses focused on cancers that respond well to the treatment or when tumor locations do not allow for surgical removal. New radiotherapies and radioactive diagnostic approaches are revolutionizing our understanding and treatment approach for a range of diseases and conditions. Below are four companies involved in radiotherapies or radioactive diagnostics that I believe are poised to see their stocks perform well in the year ahead.</p><p><strong>General Electric (GE)</strong> generally does not come to mind when discussing radiotherapies, but it should. Nuclear medicine is a growing field, and GE, through its subsidiary GE Healthcare, has a wide variety of diagnostic solutions in development. GE also manufactures a wide range of imaging resources including <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146309.php"">MRI</a>, PET, and CT scanners that deliver a clear visual image of the body. GE Healthcare also has teamed with <strong>Merck (MRK)</strong> to collaborate on an experimental therapy to diagnose and treat Alzheimer's using GE's PET amyloid-imaging agent, flutemetamol, to detect signs of Alzheimer's, along with Merck's lead Alzheimer's drug candidate, MK-8931, which targets beta amyloid thought to affect the lead-up of neuron degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. 5.3 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's, and the number of Alzheimer's cases is expected to triple by 2050s. In the U.S. alone the <a href=""http://redwoodage.com/content/view/231450/45"">cost</a> to treat Alzheimer's is approximately $172 billion a year, and is expected to rise to $1 trillion by 2050.</p><p>Beta amyloids are proteins that can clump together and form plaques in the brain, commonly found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Flutemetamol, a tracer molecule associated with the <a href=""http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/pet-mr/content/article/113619/1913011"">isotope fluorine-18</a>, binds to beta-amyloid, and therefore can be used as an imaging agent to detect beta amyloid deposits, which in turn should then be able to better identify patients who might benefit from MK-8931. Preliminary <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/244103.php"">results</a> from two Phase II trials with flutemetamol have met their primary endpoints to <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/ge-healthcare-announces-results-phase-110320360.html"">confirm</a> the potential application of flutemetamol as an imaging agent to detect beta amyloid plaque. Separately, MK-8931, Merck's novel investigational oral &beta;-amyloid precursor protein site-cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor, entered Phase II/III <a href=""http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20121203005589/en/Merck-Initiates-Phase-IIIII-Study-Investigational-BACE"">clinical trial</a> designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy versus placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. MK-8931 <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/253517.php"">inhibits</a> the BACE enzyme, which is vital in the production of amyloid &beta; peptide, believed to be the underlying cause of Alzheimer's. Using this approach, MK-8931 is being developed to prevent the formation of amyloid plaque deposits.</p><p>GE closed on Wednesday February 20th at $23.41 per share, just under its 52-week high. The company, which has its hands in a vast array of industries, including GE Capital, aviation, transportation, energy infrastructure, and GE Healthcare, has a market capitalization of $245.5 billion. For 2012, GE posted a <a href=""http://www.dailyfinance.com/2013/01/18/ge-earnings-rise-on-strength-of-emerging-markets/"">net income</a> of $13.6 billion on revenue of $147.4 billion, up from net income of $13.1 billion and revenue of $147.3 billion in 2011. The company plans on completing its $18 billion sale of NBC Universal to <a href=""http://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/what-will-general-electric-company-ge-do-with-its-pile-of-cash-66251/"">Comcast</a> by the end of the 1st quarter, which will add to GE's cash stockpile of roughly $95 billion. The cash will help move forward the proposed buy back of about $10 billion in company shares throughout the year.</p><p>I like GE, I think its worst days are in the rear view mirror; <a href=""http://www.nasdaq.com/article/general-electric-company-ge-exdividend-date-scheduled-for-february-21-2013-cm218783"">Zacks</a> Investment Research expects GE to see earnings growth of 9.7% in 2013, well above the industry average of 3.2%. GE is an excellent company to have in one's long-term portfolio; the company appears to be refocused, has a tremendous amount of cash on hand; it's been working diligently to cut costs, and has been actively pursuing new interests in emerging markets. I am long on GE, but I wouldn't be surprised to see a slight pullback before the stock begins to rise again.</p><p><strong>Eli Lilly (LLY)</strong> expanded into nuclear medicine in 2010 when it <a href=""http://bostonbiotechwatch.com/2010/12/09/lillys-big-buy-of-avid-anticipates-alzheimers-therapies-that-actually-work/"">acquired</a> AVID Radiopharmaceuticals in a deal that cost upwards of $800 million. Many analysts believe that Lilly paid a premium for the company, but it did so to receive the radiopharmaceutical drug florbetapir, now with the trade name Amyvid. Like GE's flutemetamol, Amyvid was developed to assist doctors in diagnosing Alzheimer's and track the progression of the disease. Last April the FDA <a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-approves-amyvid-florbetapir-f-18-injection-for-use-in-patients-being-evaluated-for-alzheimers-disease-and-other-causes-of-cognitive-decline-146497155.html"">approved</a> Amyvid for detecting beta-amyloid plaques in patients with cognitive impairment who are being tested for Alzheimer's disease. The European Union followed up by <a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amyvid-florbetapir-f-18-injection-approved-in-european-union-for-use-in-patients-with-cognitive-impairment-being-evaluated-for-alzheimers-disease-and-other-causes-of-cognitive-impairment-187003881.html"">approving</a> Amyvid earlier this year. Amyvid is a radioactive diagnostic agent that, like GE's flutemetamol, utilized the isotope fluorine-18. Amyvid is injected into the bloodstream, where it crosses the blood-brain barrier and selectively binds to amyloid plaques, allowing radiologists to see signs of Alzheimer's on a PET scan, potentially allowing an earlier diagnosis. To date, the tests are being used mainly to rule out Alzheimer's, as patients who have no brain plaque do not have Alzheimer's.</p><p>Lilly, a $62.6 billion market cap company, has seen its stock rise 40% year-over-year. The stock continues to see positive results - up almost 10% year-to-date. To some its upward trend could be a tad surprising considering that Lilly has not had the success it expected with its <a href=""http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/five-down-another-eli-lilly-drug-flunks-phase-iii-test/2012-09-06"">pipeline</a> of products, as a number of its drugs in <a href=""http://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/eli-lilly-co-lly-if-youre-going-to-fail-fail-quickly-57725/"">clinical trials</a> have failed, including tabalumab for rheumatoid arthritis, Alimta for lung cancer, pomaglumetad methionil for schizophrenia, and Forteo for back pain. Also harming the company's bottom line are the drugs that have come off, or are soon coming off, patent protection. An example is Zyprexa, which once boasted $4.92 billion in yearly sales, has slid 49% after coming off patent. To add to the bearish trend, the company's other successful drug Cymbalta, with $3.07 billion in sales, loses <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/business/01lilly.html?_r=0"">patent protection</a> this June.</p><p>On February 15th the Jefferies Group reissued its underperform <a href=""http://www.jagsreport.com/2013/02/eli-lilly-co-receives-underperform-rating-from-jefferies-group-lly/"">rating</a>, and currently has a $43.00 price target on the stock. At the end of last month, Goldman Sachs reiterated a neutral rating and raised its target price from $54.00 per share to $56.00 per share. Lilly has a solid <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/dividendchannel/2013/02/12/why-eli-lilly-co-is-a-top-25-dividend-giant/"">dividend</a> of $1.96 per share, paid in quarterly installments. The company saw quarterly earnings of $0.85 per share beating analysts' estimates of $0.79 per share. I wouldn't be too quick to dismiss Lilly; it still has a number of drugs in late stages of clinical trials and has implemented cost cuts helping sustain its profit levels. I am a hold on Lilly, but if the stock has a pullback it could make for a good buying opportunity.</p><p>While radiotherapy has made great strides in diagnosing and treating certain illnesses, and the use of radiotherapies will continue to increase, there is one caveat in the deck: Radiotherapies require nuclear isotopes and, due to government regulations and aging nuclear reactors, there is a shortage of medical isotopes today. A small company out of Washington State, <strong>Advanced Medical Isotope Corporation (ADMD.OB)</strong> is engaged in the production and distribution of medical isotopes. The company hopes to remedy the isotope shortage issue and to become a major producer of medical isotopes for the U.S. The market for medical isotopes represents over $1 billion a year. In the U.S. 18 million medical <a href=""http://www.isotopeworld.com/about-amic-/company-history/"">procedures</a> are performed using medical isotopes, in Europe the number is 10 million, and those numbers are expected to grow at 10% annually. In the United States, approximately 90% of the medical isotopes used come from foreign countries.</p><p>ADMD is positioning itself to be the top producer of medical Isotopes in the U.S., utilizing its relationships with the University of Missouri at Columbia, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the University of Utah and, most recently, Colorado State University, to produce isotopes at their research reactors. In its own facility in Washington, ADMD uses the PULSAR Isotope Production system, which is a compact <a href=""http://www.isotopeworld.com/isotope-solutions/amic-facilities/"">linear accelerator</a> (LINAC) designed to produce the full spectrum of PET imaging radioisotopes for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. LINAC replaces the larger cyclotron systems for the production of medical isotopes. Along with radioisotopes molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) and technetium-99m (Tech-99), both used in 80% of all the nuclear medical procedures worldwide, ADMD produces a number of other isotopes for the medical community, including <a href=""http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2008/05/27/378898/143429/en/Advanced-Medical-Isotope-Corporation-Begins-Producing-Fluorine-18.html"">fluorine-18</a>, the same isotope used in both GE's and Lilly's PET imaging product for Alzheimer's.</p><p>While I can see potential in its isotope production, what has caught my interest about the company is that ADMD is also developing a novel approach to targeting cancer tumors with an injectable radiotherapy, RadioGel. RadioGel consists of isotope Y-90 microspheres in a water-based polymer. The polymer is injected directly into the tumor using a needle, and once injected the polymer quickly begins to warm to body temperature. This temperature change transforms the gel into a lattice-like structure, trapping the Y-90 in the targeted tumor. High-energy beta particles irradiate the cancer cells within the targeted mass, allowing little systemic irradiation from the trapped Y-90. RadioGel would allow medical personnel to deliver higher doses of radiation exactly where needed, especially in tumors that cannot be surgically removed.</p><p>RadioGel is versatile; it can be injected through the skin or during a surgical procedure when a cancer tumor cannot be surgically removed. According to James C. Katzaroff, CEO of ADMD, <em>&quot;RadioGel will provide doctors with greater flexibility to safely direct radiation therapy to the interior of tumors, as well as to tumor margins following surgical removal. We anticipate further development of RadioGel products that will eventually be used to treat cancers of the breast, liver, kidneys, and pancreas, as well as the brain and neck.&quot;</em></p><p>In what could be considered a big step forward for the company, earlier this month ADMD submitted data on RadioGel to the FDA and requested a <a href=""http://www.isotopeworld.com/investor-relations/news/39/"">collaborative meeting</a>, which represents the initial step in the FDA's pre-market review process. Based on favorable results of animal studies recently concluded at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the company is submitting to the Washington State Department of Health the information required for a Sealed Source and Device registration, which will allow the use of the RadioGel in hospitals and clinics to be authorized in Nuclear Regulatory Commission Agreement States. ADMD believes RadioGel has the potential to be a blockbuster therapy and estimates sales could grow as high as $70 million to $100 million.</p><p>Advanced Medical Isotope is a small company with a lot of potential. It has a market cap of $14.6 million. In 2012 the company saw its stock grow 83%. This year the stock has moved very little, and sits where it began the year, at $0.18 per share. But there is great opportunity in ADMD with its isotope business and RadioGel. If RadioGel continues to show progress I wouldn't be surprised if a larger pharmaceutical company would either invest in a collaborative effort with RadioGel or just buy the company outright. I am long on ADMD and see it as a sleeper stock that could potentially generate high profits. But along with great rewards there are risks investing in nano-cap companies. Know your risk tolerance, and caution is always advised for this type of investment.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long on GE and ADMD.

"1081461","2012-12-25 09:33:41","Investments In Novel IL-12 Adminstration Platforms In The Fight Against Cancer","<p><a href=""http://dictionary.webmd.com/terms/cytokine"">Cytokines</a> comprise a category of signaling proteins, peptides, or glycoproteins that are used extensively in cellular communication. They include a large and diverse family of polypeptide regulators that are produced widely throughout the body by various types of cells. Interleukins are cytokines used to regulate inflammatory and immune responses by activating the body's white blood cells, such as T-lymphocytes (T cells). There are more than 20 known types of interleukins, with the clinical use of some having varying levels of success in the fight against cancer.</p><p>Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is largely produced by monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells in response to bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide ((LPS)) and intracellular pathogens. It can induce IFN gamma production, cell proliferation, and cytotoxicity mediated by natural killer ((NK)) cells and T cells-all immune responses that can be used against not only the typical foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses, but also cancer cells. However, its use as an anti-tumor agent must be carefully balanced as the toxicity of the IL-12 is <a href=""http://www.nature.com/gt/journal/v8/n4/abs/3301387a.html"">well documented</a>. Target organs affected include the <a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/lymphohematopoietic"">lymphohematopoietic</a> system, intestines, liver, and lungs; which necessitate careful administration technique and schedules. Due to recent events more fully validating increasingly promising use of IL-12, I thought it important to delve into some pharmaceutical companies that are evaluating its effectiveness in fighting cancer.</p><p><strong>Ziopharm's Adenovirus-Delivered IL-12 gene Administration</strong></p><p><strong>Ziopharm Oncology (ZIOP)</strong> has a growing pipeline of therapies being evaluated for treating various types of cancers. Its pipeline is heralded by palifosfamide, an alkylating chemotherapy drug designed to halt tumor growth by binding to cancer cell DNA and interfering with its function. Palifosfamide is in Phase III trials evaluating its effectiveness in treating extensive-stage small cell lung cancer ((SCLC)) and metastatic soft tissue sarcoma ((STS)).</p><p>However, the earlier stage IL-12 DNA program has been grabbing headlines recently as well. On <a href=""http://ir.ziopharm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=716220"">October 25th</a> the company announced Phase I data and Phase II initiation of Ad-RTS IL-12, a novel DNA-based therapeutic candidate to treat advanced melanoma. Phase I data of a 13-patient set indicated clinical response in 5 of 7 patients dosed at the higher dosage levels. In terms of safety, there were two related adverse events of note: pyrexia and cytopenia.</p><p>The Phase II trial initiation announced in the press release is expected to enroll 15 patients with unresectable (inoperable) stage 3 or 4 melanoma to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of intratumoral injections of Ad-RTS IL-12. A step beyond the older technology of merely injecting IL-12 cytokines into targeted tumors, Ad-RTS IL-12 employs the use of an adenoviral vector to deliver into the patients' cells a gene which causes the cells to produce IL-12. Termed the <a href=""http://www.ziopharm.com/content/docs/ASGCT-Murugesan_proof-1.pdf"">RheoSwitch Therapeutic System&trade; (RTS&trade;)</a>, Ziopharm gained rights to the technology via a <a href=""http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/ziopharm-gains-access-intrexons-synthetic-biology-tech/2011-01-07"">January 2011 agreement</a> with the developer, Germany-based Intrexon Corporation.</p><p>In order to control the IL-12 expression, an inducible promoter is utilized, which is conditionally activated by an orally bioavailable small molecule activator ligand ((L)), RG115932. This controlled IL-12 expression causes a strong immune response directly against the cells having this expression. With a careful balancing act of injection amount and activator ligand, most of the adenovirus-delivered IL-12 gene is at the tumor site where the immune response should focus. Early in a Phase II trial, interim updates on this trial should be forthcoming and will give an indication of the efficacy and safety profile of the regimen.</p><p>Particularly interesting in the Phase I trial data was the observation that &quot;An important early sign of this effect was manifested in lesions not injected with Ad-RTS IL-12, where clinical response was observed, indicating systemic, anti-cancer immune activity.&quot; This immune system response, if robust and long-term, could indicate a therapy which would not only treat the targeted melanoma (locally and systemically), but could also help prevent its recurrence.</p><p>The systemic response, seen in some successful immunotherapy agents used to fight cancer, is most likely the result of local dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells that were exposed to the dying cancer cell fragments when the cells were targeted by the immune stem as part of the initial treatment regimen. These cell fragments help to &quot;teach&quot; the immune system what the cancer cells &quot;look&quot; like and enable them to target the distant (not at injection site) melanoma cells as well.</p><p>Although much of Ziopharm's current $328 million market capitalization is attributed to palifosfamide, investors should certainly be watching for updates on Ad-RTS IL-12 in the coming months. The company's common shares are trading near their YTD lows with short-term support seen at $4.00, providing for good near-term entry for interested shareholders. Additional research is advised before opening a position in the company, with the company's <a href=""http://ir.ziopharm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=719920"">most recent 10Q</a> being an advisable next step.</p><p><em>(click to enlarge)<a href=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2012/12/23/399559-1356316303300259-Chemistfrog_origin.png"" rel=""lightbox""><img src=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2012/12/23/399559-1356316303300259-Chemistfrog.png"" alt=""ZIOP 3-Month Chart"" hspace=""6"" vspace=""6"" /></a></em></p><p><strong>OncoSec Medical's Electroporation Delivered IL-12 Gene</strong></p><p><strong>OncoSec Medical Inc (ONCS.OB)</strong> has had an impressive year with many promising developments in its pipeline. The company's OncoSec Medical System ((OMS)) platform is based on an electroporation administration system it licensed from Inovio Pharmaceuticals (INO) in <a href=""http://ir.inovio.com/index.php?s=43%26item=17"">March of 2011</a>. The license pertains to &quot;certain non-DNA vaccine technology and intellectual property relating to electroporation technology useful for electrochemical and cytokine- based immune therapies for treating solid tumors.&quot; The OMS system is based on a unique physiological response cell membranes have when exposed to electrical stimulation. OncoSec's administration device is a 6-needle (actually 6-electrode) hand-held applicator that is used to apply a brief electrical current across the targeted tumors.</p><p>The current causes a significant increase in the permeability of the affected cells' membranes, which dramatically increases cellular uptake of a pre-injected agent (<a href=""http://www.mddionline.com/article/oncoSec-could-revolutionize-oncology-therapy"">4,000 to 10,000-fold</a>), thereby increasing the agent's effectiveness. Once the current is removed, the cell membranes return to their original states, trapping the incorporated agents inside. The administration is favorable due to not only the increased effectiveness of the agents by being quickly delivered to the cells' interiors where they work more effectively, but less of the agent is required to have the same level of efficacy-or the same amount of agent may be used with even greater efficacy. Just as important is the fact that the administration technique focuses on keeping the agents in a centralized area rather than allowing the often toxic agents to cause systemic side effects.</p><p>OncoSec's OMS platform is currently being evaluated for two different types of therapies. NeoPulse utilizes the chemotherapy agent, bleomycin, which has been evaluated in <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-oms-electrochemotherapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-shows-enhanced-quality-of-life-in-two-randomized-phase-iii-studies"">Phase III trials</a> successfully against head and neck cancer. Details of these results are certainly worth investigating, but are beyond the scope of this article. The company's ImmunoPulse platform utilizes electroporation to administer DNA IL-12, a plasmid DNA construct coded with instructions for the cells to produce the IL-12 cytokine. The therapy is injected at the targeted tumor site where it is subsequently electroporated. This electroporation keeps the toxic IL-12 cytokine localized in the tumor area with little left circulating throughout the body. Cells that produce (or express) the IL-12 are recognized as foreign by the immune system and are attacked accordingly.</p><p>Like Ziopharm's Ad-RTS IL-12, clinical data indicate a systemic response against the targeted cancer type rather than just a local response at the administration site. However, I believe the likely lysing (cell disintegration/degradation) induced by the electroporation technique provides for much more efficient exposure of the specific cancer cell type's antigens to dendritic and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) than the simple intratumorally-injected IL-12 of old or even perhaps more efficient than Ad-RTS IL-12.</p><p>In other words, the more efficient breakdown of the cancer cells via the electroporation (electro-shock) procedure gives more cell fragments (proteins, etc.) for the dendritic cells and APCs to use and create an immune response against those cell types, not just the cells locally producing the IL-12 cytokine. If this is the case, then the systemic immune response against the targeted tissue type may be stronger and more robust.</p><p>An example of this type of presentation is seen in an <a href=""http://www.hindawi.com/journals/cdi/2010/689171/"">article</a> addressing the immunotherapy approach to targeting glioblastoma (brain cancer). The article notes:</p><blockquote class=""quote""><p><em>Several antigen sources can be used for active immunotherapy such as intact tumour cells</em>, <em>tumour protein lysates</em> (of particular note for my case), <em>tumour-derived mRNA, peptides eluded from tumour MHC class I molecules, and synthetic peptides. Antigens can be used alone and injected in the presence of different adjuvants or presented on DCs which play a key role in initiating the immune reaction.</em></p></blockquote><p>Time and clinical data will only tell if the increased cell lysate produced from the electroporation device is a significant variable, or if the majority of the immune system &quot;learning&quot; what the cancer cells look like is due to the local exposure of the dying cells that have been attacked by natural and killer T-cells and IFN gamma production.</p><p>The company has two on-going Phase II trials underway and had interim data released in Q4 2012, each with promising results. On <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/oncosec-medical-incorporated-reports-positive-100700929.html"">October 23rd</a> OncoSec presented Phase II data evaluating the ImmunoPulse platform's treatment for Merkel cell carcinoma ((MCC)). Of the small 5-patient trial enrolled so far, two patients withdrew after one of the two treatment cycles due to disease progression. The three remaining patients were treated with two cycles of the therapy and had increased levels of IL-12 expression in tumor biopsy sampled three weeks post-treatment relative to pre-treatment sampling.</p><p>Of these three, one had a confirmed response (over 70% regression) that had persisted for about 8 months at the time of the data unveiling. The safety profile of the regimen has been impressive so far with it being construed as safe and well-tolerated with grade one pain and grade one injection site reaction with no discernible systemic toxicity.</p><p>On <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/oncosec-medical-reports-positive-preliminary-110200758.html"">November 15th</a>, OncoSec presented interim data from its ImmunoPulse platform's trial evaluating its efficacy and safety in treating patients with the larger indication metastatic melanoma. Interim data in the 15-patient trial noted 13 subjects were evaluable at 39 days, 9 at 90 days and 2 at 180 days. 95% of treated lesions demonstrated response at 39 days (14% stable disease ((SD)), 42% partial response ((PR)), 39% complete response ((CR)), at 90 days results were (50% PR, 45% CR) and at 180 days (33% PR and 77% CR). At 180 days, 2 subjects were evaluable for ORR (per the trial's design, ORR is to be measured at 180 days). Of the 2 evaluable patients, 1 had a confirmed stable disease.</p><p>The 2nd patient had a near-complete response of all treated and untreated lesions. Ongoing updates and interim data analyses will be key for this trial. Continued systemic immune response against the melanoma tumors throughout the patients' bodies would be a sign of a trained immune system fighting the cancer on its own. Long-term immune response is also key, ensuring the response is both robust and effective.</p><p>OncoSec Medical is a microcap company with a current valuation of only about $19.6 million at market close on Monday, December 24th. It is still dependent on investors' capital to fund its operations, typical of small cap development-phase pharmaceuticals. On December 13th, the company announced a $7.3 million offering to fund the development of its research. Although dilutive to existing shareholders, the ensuing share price drop from the previous day's $0.31 to the opening price on December 13th of $0.23 does allow for a better entry for new investors. Still trading in the low $0.20s, the upside here could be significant if interim Phase II data updates begin giving more indications of the ImmunoPulse's safety profile and efficacy against not only the targeted, but also the distant lesions (tumors). Downside risk is obviously there if the trials fail.</p><p>However, the NeoPulse platform's success in using the chemotherapy agent, bleomycin, provides for some diversification with promising Phase III data behind them, and a <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/oncosec-receives-ce-mark-electroporation-100700813.html"">CE mark</a> to the company's credit as of October 17th. Another catalyst &quot;lying in wait&quot; is any announcement from the company pertaining to licensing or partnering out the NeoPulse platform as hinted at in my <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/896721-interview-with-oncosec-ceo-punit-dhillon"">October 1st interview</a> with company CEO, Punit Dhillon. Pertaining to the NeoPulse platform, especially for the head and neck cancer indication, Mr. Dhillon stated:</p><blockquote class=""quote""><p><em>Our focus for the NeoPulse program is to present the data to a number of specifically targeted potential partners for their evaluation as a license opportunity.

Although the company's upside potential isn't as great with a successful development of its candidate, the company's common shares do represent a safer bet for those investors desiring a more stable company with virtually no downside due to any failure of its IL-12 evaluation for cancer treatment. The company's candidate, <a href=""http://www.merckserono.com/en/science/pipeline/phase_i/phase_1.html"">NHS-IL 12</a>, is being evaluated for its potential in treating solid tumors, like the previous two candidates.</p><p>Partially validating the concept of systemic response to a certain tumor type as a result of treating one or a few tumors with IL-12, Merck describes the therapy as &quot;an investigational cancer immunotherapy that is designed to target the DNA fragments released from the dead and dying (necrotic) cells found in the context of many solid tumors.&quot; NHS-IL 12 is actually a novel immunocytokine formed by linking two molecules of IL-12 to a fully humanized antibody termed NHS76. This antibody is designed to target dead cancer cell portions of tumors because of its high affinity for single- and double-stranded DNA, which are exposed as tumors outgrow their blood supplies and die.</p><p>A Phase I trial investigating <a href=""http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/short/72/8_MeetingAbstracts/1536?rss=1"">NS-IL 12 for the treatment of solid tumors</a> is currently underway that is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute ((NCI)). Preclinical data evaluating the use of the antibody-cytokine pairing was promising in mouse models. Data indicated superior in vivo localization of IL-12 (concentration of IL-12 cytokines) in mouse tumors following subcutaneous NHS-IL 12 injection relative to administration of recombinant IL-12 (rIL-12) or IL-12 fused to a control antibody (BC1).</p><p>Most interestingly, however, was the comparison of NS-IL 12 administered in vitro (outside the body in a &quot;test tube setting&quot;) relative to in vivo (in the body, in a real-world biologic setting). In mice having MC38/CEA+ colorectal carcinoma, NS-IL 12 &quot;significantly delayed subcutaneous tumor growth&quot; more effectively than those injected with typical IL-12 intratumorally. However, NHS-IL 12 did not inhibit MC38/CEA+ tumor cell growth in vitro. This indicates that the therapy acts indirectly in the mouse models via a learned immune response.</p><p>The current <a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01417546"">NCI-sponsored Phase I trial</a> is targeting patients with metastasized solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatment regimen. The accrual ceiling for the trial is 78 patients with 2 patients per month being enrolled. Of special note on the administration of NS-IL 12 is its injection per its trial description at clinicaltrials.gov. It is described as injected &quot;subcutaneously as a onetime dose in patients with metastatic or locally advanced solid epithelial or mesenchymal tumors.&quot; The therapy will simply be injected as a typical vaccine under the patient's skin, not into the tumors (intratumorally). The trial is expected to be completed in July 2014, although I expect to see data out earlier, such as in <a href=""http://www.asco.org/"">ASCO's annual meeting</a> in late May/early June of 2014.</p><p>Merck's common shares are now trading at $41.42, with a 52-week range of $36.91-$48.00. The company's shares had a recent setback due to failure of its late-stage HPS2-THRIVE trial evaluating TREDAPTIVE's (extended-release niacin and laropiprant) effect on the combination of coronary deaths, non-fatal heart attacks, strokes, or revascularizations compared to statin therapy alone. This setback may make a prime entry position into one of the world's most successful pharmaceutical giants. A safer investment than the other two alternatives, its upside is obviously not as significant if NS-IL 12 is successful. However, the company's $0.42 quarterly dividend does offer additional incentive and is a better investment for certain investor types.</p><p><em>(click to enlarge)<a href=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2012/12/23/399559-13563163980190206-Chemistfrog_origin.png"" rel=""lightbox""><img src=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2012/12/23/399559-13563163980190206-Chemistfrog.png"" hspace=""6"" vspace=""6"" /></a></em></p><p>According to the National Cancer Institute, more than <a href=""http://bethesdatrials.cancer.gov/solid_tumor/index.aspx"">1.55 million people</a> will be diagnosed with a malignant solid tumor in 2012.

Investment potential for each of these candidates is promising. Merck's upside would be limited in the event of success with its Phase I trial, but so would its downside if it suffered a setback. Ziopharm's market capitalization and current share price is in large part due to palifosfamide's potential in treating SCLC.</p><p>However, success in its Phase II trial evaluating Ad-RTS IL-12 for melanoma could be a large share price driver in coming months if interim data proves to be promising. OncoSec's ImmunoPulse Phase II trials underway have shown early-stage success for the $19.6 million development phase company. The next interim data evaluations are critical for this company as these trials will have more enrolled patients and should give a better indication of the systemic response seen in the early interim data sets. I believe that it is possible that the destruction of cancer cells at the electroporation probe administration site could provide for additional cell fragments for the dendritic cells and APCs to use and create a systemic immune response against those cell types; in addition to the local ImmunoPulse-induced IL-12 expression by the targeted tumor cells.</p><p>Interested investors are advised to closely evaluate each company's upside and downside potential with the upcoming catalysts in mind.

"871501","2012-09-17 13:31:46","Biotechnology: Valuation Doesn't Always Indicate Value","<p>The key to returning large gains in the developmental biotechnology space is to understand that valuation doesn't indicate actual value. There is a misconception among retail investors that if you invest in a company with a promising late-stage candidate that has a $1 billion valuation or more, that it will return large gains over a course of many years and is more likely to gain a regulatory approval. Although this may often be the case, there are simply too many exceptions for this to be a wise trading method. When a pharmaceutical company trades with a multi-billion dollar valuation in the clinical phase it is usually because d<span>ata is stron</span>g, the demand is significant, and it has successfully executed throughout clinical trials, therefore, providing a clear path to an FDA approval. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that it will return the largest gains, as often the valuations are too high, the expectations are often unrealistic, and the stocks often return a loss either upon approval or after sales fail to live up to the high expectations that come with being a billion dollar clinical phase company.</p><p>A good example of this scenario played out with Dendreon Corporation (DNDN). Dendreon was a $4 billion company before it ever marketed a drug. Aside from the fact that it has run into countless issues since earning an FDA approval, its expectations were insane-- so high that sales could never satisfy the street's expectations. Typically, these companies with excessive valuations prior to or following an FDA approval, will pullback in the first year when sales do not meet such extravagant expectations, as it takes time to manufacture, market, and sell newly approved drugs. When a company is overvalued from the start, there is no room for error. Those that do meet expectations, but are still expensive or overvalued, end up like LinkedIn (LNKD), which is a company that would have to post 100% sales growth for several years just to be considered &quot;fairly valued&quot; at current prices.</p><p>For some, investing in a perceived safe, guaranteed, and overvalued biotechnology company is their preference, which is fine. I have always preferred companies, such as Threshold Pharmaceuticals (THLD) and Celldex (CLDX), which are undervalued as pertaining to clinical data and potential. They could grow accordingly over a course of many years, both during clinical development and after approval. I prefer companies that grow pipelines through acquisitions, are able to find value in the market from underdeveloped drugs and then develop the drugs with either a new indication or further develop a promising candidate that may have slipped through the eyes of large pharma. For some reason, you rarely see large pharma acquire drugs for value-presenting prices. It seems that large pharma would rather purchase companies, such as Amlyn, Pharmasset or Inhibitex, for prices that will take many years to pay off in terms of net income-- that is if the acquisition ever pays off. Whatever the reason, large pharma executives find this approach to be logical and preferable to the alternate bargain-basement deals.</p><p>Rather than purchasing $5 billion companies with a lead product that will only return $1 billion in revenue (and may only return $250 million in net income), I prefer $10 million acquisitions of candidates that could return $100 million in revenue, and that could pay off shortly following an approval. The market is full of successful companies that fall in this category, as well as companies that have acquired drugs returning great revenue and continued growth. The problem, to which I have alluded, is that the market places a value on the drug, based on its acquisition price. This often leads to the acquiring company being undervalued, allowing the stock to appreciate with fundamentals and present value for investors.</p><p>The fact of the matter is that large pharma often miss opportunities, and rarely even looks for them. Rarely do we hear of large pharma acquiring a late-stage candidate for less than $50 million. However, once the candidate appreciates and reaches a &quot;value&quot; of a billion dollars or more, large pharma often come in and scoop up the drug-- even those drugs that have been acquired for much less by a previous company. For example, back before Zytiga was an expected blockbuster and was <a href=""http://www.jnj.com/connect/news/all/20090521_160000"">acquired</a> by Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) for $1 billion, it was acquired by another company for much less. Most people aren't aware that just a few years before JNJ's billion dollar purchase, Zytiga was acquired by Cougar Pharmaceuticals (the company JNJ acquired) for just $1 million! Cougar saw the value in the drug, developed it, and then sold it for a larger profit than the drug will ever return to JNJ. Zytiga may post sales that far exceed $1 billion; however, it will take quite some time before the company actually returns a profit from its $1 billion purchase.</p><p>In addition to the Zytiga blockbuster (for Cougar), there are numerous examples of companies acquiring candidates and appreciating with unprecedented gains. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) <a href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2005/04/18/daily19.html"">purchased</a> Orphan Medical back in 2005 for $120 million and obtained the rights to Xyrem, a drug that returned over $230 million in sales in 2011 and is <a href=""http://www.istockanalyst.com/finance/story/5861529/jazz-pharma-jazz-compelling-specialty-pharma-stock-spearheaded-by-xyrem"">expected</a> to reach peak annual sales near $1 billion. JAZZ is a stock I purchased back in 2010. I actually contemplated the investment because I felt the $120 million price paid for Orphan was a little too pricey. However, JAZZ also obtained a sales force along with a one-of-a-kind promising candidate that has paid off with huge gains.</p><p>Aside from Jazz, I also purchased shares in Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (SPPI) and Questcor Pharmaceuticals (QCOR), which were both instrumental in developing this strategy. Fusilev, which is Spectrum's fast-growing lead drug, was acquired for just $20,000 in 2006, and Questcor purchased its fast-growing multi-purpose drug, Acthar, for just $200,000. Both are lessons that the price paid to acquire a candidate often does not indicate its growth potential, nor does it tell the value of a company. Yet, because all three of these companies acquired candidates for such cheap prices, none trade with gaudy valuations, but have rather grown steadily via fundamentals. Despite the fact that each has proven its doubters to be wrong, some still can't get past the value that each of these companies found while large pharma seems more willing to pay billions for its products. Investors should seek the principals instilled at companies, such as the aforementioned three, in which wise drug acquisitions will carry these companies for years via earnings and fundamentals.</p><p>One mistake that I've made is selling all three of the stocks mentioned above, all which would've returned market-leading gains. I settled for mediocre gains of less than 200%, while in the case of JAZZ and QCOR, my gains could've been over 1,000%. I have since re-purchased and own each of the three stocks, and continue to search for companies that I feel possess the same qualities that led to such success for these three companies. Currently, the only stock I own in this category is Galena Biopharma (GALE), a stock I purchased at the start of the year, which has returned a 300% gain due to early success with its breast cancer drug candidate, NeuVax.</p><p><em>The purpose of this article is not to discuss specific ideas or stocks but rather discuss this strategy so that others understand. However, it would perhaps add to the conversation if I explain my purpose for investing in GALE.</em></p><p>Galena <a href=""http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2011/03/31/rxi-buys-apthera-names-new-ceo/"">purchased</a> Apthera for its lead candidate, NeuVax, for about $7 million. Galena has been <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/448501-galena-biopharma-s-patent-creates-both-immediate-and-long-term-upside"">awarded</a> crucial patents, <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/614201-neuvax-developer-dr-peoples-eliminates-speculation-for-facts"">announced</a> very encouraging data, and has enrolled patients in its Phase 3 trial that will test 700-1,000 patients with low to intermediate levels of HER2. Like Spectrum, Questcor, and Jazz, many have doubted Galena, with almost all bears mentioning the price paid to acquire NeuVax, a reflection of the opinion that a drug must be acquired for large premiums to be promising.</p><p>In a Phase 2 trial of 187 patients, those treated with NeuVax saw a 50% <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/614201-neuvax-developer-dr-peoples-eliminates-speculation-for-facts"">reduction</a> in the recurrence of breast cancer after standard of care treatment in patients with low to intermediate expressions of HER2. Currently, there is nothing on the market that treats patients for this specific indication. The most common comparison is Herceptin, a $6 billion per year drug that treats patients with high levels of HER2, which only account for 25% to one-third of breast cancer patients. NeuVax, if proven effective, would treat anywhere from 50% to 75% of breast cancer patients, signaling unprecedented potential in terms of revenue. What's even more encouraging is that it will be attempting to meet the same endpoints used in its Phase 2 trial, which already has tested 187 patients and showed a 50% decrease in recurrence. This is a nice indication that it will have positive outcomes in Phase 3 trials.</p><p>Based on these facts, you can see the reasons that I chose GALE. The company purchased NeuVax for next to nothing, due to Apthera's financial strains. It has a great scientific team led by world renowned oncologist, Dr. George Peoples. With its current valuation, compare<span>d with p</span>otential, I felt as though the upside far exceeded the downside. I believe it is the best-in-class of companies that are building a future through cheap acquisitions, although I am always looking for others.</p><p>The final point I'd like to make is that this strategy is not for everyone. It is not a &quot;get rich quick&quot; scheme. It requires patience, due diligence, and the self-control to endure excessive volatility, and also the ability to admit defeat when you're wrong. These investments are high risk and should only be purchased in amounts commensurate with the risk tolerance of the individual investor, within this category of biotechnology companies. If a company does find a diamond in the rough, the rewards could be huge; but the risk must be balanced with the potential rewards. For example, a $5,000 investment in QCOR back in 2007 would be worth over $600,000 today. When you put that into perspective and assess the risk versus reward, you can see that by using this strategy of buying undervalued companies, which acquire promising candidates with encouraging clinical data, the upside far outweighs the downside. However, you must stick to the industries you know, use common sense, and also first view clinical data with both eyes open, with a balanced point-of-view. By doing this, you just might realize the level of upside presenting itself in a biotechnology industry that is innovating at an incredibly rapid rate.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[SPPI]], [[JAZZ]], [[QCOR]], [[GALE]].

"894551","2012-09-28 12:08:57","4 Share Price Dips That Might Only Be Temporary","<p><em>It's been a sideways trading week for the markets thus far, although the modest dip by the DOW on Wednesday could be an indication that many are consolidating positions in anticipation of a possible broad market downturn. Some stocks have taken a harder hit than others so far this week and here's just a few of them to keep an eye on as the dips experienced by these companies may be more the result of trading patterns and only be temporary...</em></p><p><strong>Amarin Corporation (AMRN)</strong><strong>:</strong> Amarin shares dropped at the week's open on Monday and have continued with their downward trend ever since, closing Wednesday at just under the twelve dollar mark. Shares were flying earlier this summer, however, just before the company's flagship product, Vascepa, received an FDA <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-weekly-stock-watch-week-of-july-30-amrn-hznp-ctso-fb-znga-mcd-yum-sbux"">approval</a> for the treatment of very high triglycerides. Concerns over whether or not the FDA will eventually grant a new chemical entity (NCE) status to Vascepa has weighed heavily on the share price, especially after the second delay was <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-weekly-stock-watch-week-of-17-september-amrn-sgyp-irwd-frx-ssh-nbs-actc-aezs-kerx-ttnp"">announced</a> earlier this month. Although Amarin is building a solid foundation of patents to protect its technology, NCE status would provide more rock-solid protection for the period covered by NCE and this fact is being played up heavily by numerous investors and financial media outlets.</p><p>Amarin's drop may spell opportunity, according to the bullish argument for the stock. While concerns also exist that the company <span>may decide </span>to &quot;<span>go </span>it alone&quot; with relation to the pending Vascepa launch, which is planned for early-2013, speculation has it that ultimately Amarin will be bought out by a larger company in the pharmaceutical/healthcare sector. Such speculation propelled shares to nearly twenty dollars once before and also factored into the AMRN price rise of this summer. The drop in share price, too, may fuel the buyout argument because any potential suitors could receive a significant discount from where shares were trading just months ago. Human Genome Sciences suffered a similar share price drop earlier this year when a buyout never materialized as many investors had hoped, but when <strong>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)</strong> finally jumped in and <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-human-genome-sciences-receives-a-de-facto-buyout-offer-after-years-of-speculation"">pulled the trigger</a>, Human Genome shares doubled overnight. The same could occur for Amarin, should an offer materialize, as most estimates price a potential buyout somewhere between $22-$26/per AMRN share.</p><p>On the other side of the argument, should the company move forward and market Vascepa on its own, and should the NCE designation not come to fruition, then AMRN may have a tougher time recovering from its current levels.</p><p>Eventually, however, most consider a rebound as all but inevitable as Vascepa is predicted to become a probable blockbuster over time, especially as/if supplemental FDA approvals roll in for the treatment of high triglycerides. Therefore, many see a rebound in the works, it's mostly just an argument over &quot;when,&quot; not &quot;if.&quot;</p><p>That said, nothing is a done deal in this game until it's a done deal, so invest accordingly.</p><p><strong>Oncothyreon Inc. (ONTY)</strong><strong>:</strong> Oncothyreon shares were moving with reinvigorated life during the month of September as new analyst coverage <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-weekly-stock-watch-week-of-27-august-aapl-goog-amrn-sgyp-bmy-clsp-irwd-admd-onty-oncs-mric-imsc-ge-frx-bsx-si"">tagged</a> ONTY with a price target of $10 at a time while it was trading for under five. Shares quickly burst through the six dollar mark on high volume, but the spike didn't last long and after a ten percent Wednesday drop ONTY was right back at the five dollar mark on its highest-volumed day since early summer.</p><p>Reason to be enthusiastic about Oncothyreon revolves around an ongoing Phase III trial for the company's immunotherapeutic treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, Stimuvax, that is partnered with <strong>Merck KGaA<span></strong>. Results from this trial are slated to start rolling out in early 2013 and - as evidenced by <strong>Dendreon (DNDN)</strong> in its hey-day, shares of companies in the cancer immunotherapy sector reporting positive Phase III results could spike by monumental margins. Those bullish on the prospects of Stimuvax will keep that in mind.</p><p>Oncothyreon had spiked to ten dollars about a year ago on the Stimuvax hype - that coincided with a Jim Cramer pump on his CNBC &quot;<span>Mad </span>Money&quot; program - but came <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-these-stocks-took-a-tuesday-dive-lpath-and-oncothyreon"">crashing</a> down to earth this spring when investors took the fact that a data monitoring committee recommended continuing the trial - vice stopping it for positive results - as a bad sign. It was also at that time the company stated the early-2013 target for results-release - previous expectations were more in-line with late-2012. Shares had been slow to recover until this latest run, but ONTY's drop of this week has all but erased the previous gains.</p><p>Like AEterna's drop, however, the spiral south may have had more to do with traders responding to quick profits than to anything going on with the company. There has been no public leak of information regarding the trial and Stimuvax results are still expected early next year. As noted above, positive results could have very significant implications on the ONTY share price, so it is likely that investors and traders alike will take up their respective positions accordingly, which could add to the volatility over the coming months. With many predicting an overall market dip either before or just after the November elections, chances are investors are pulling profits from the market in order to leave some cash on the sidelines. The ONTY dip could have resulted from that phenomena, and not anything related to Stimuvax.</p><p>Also this month, the company <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/oncothyreon-expands-phase-2-trial-120000130.html"">announced</a> the expansion of a trial for its Phase II PX-866 in patients with recurrent or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, so the ONTY pipeline does not stop with Stimuvax.</p><p><strong>Neostem, Inc. (NBS)</strong><strong>:</strong> Neostem had been <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-weekly-stock-watch-week-of-17-september-amrn-sgyp-irwd-frx-ssh-nbs-actc-aezs-kerx-ttnp"">flying high</a> for weeks and hit as high as the mid-seventies during that time, but a Wednesday dip to below that mark again may be an indication that some investors have taken profit. Regardless of any dip in the Neostem share price - whether protracted or not - this company is finely positioned in the regenerative stem cell space and advancing a treatment through trials that could potentially be worth billions on the open market. AMR-001 is designed to repair damaged heart tissue following a heart attack and - as a result of the regenerative aspects of the treatment - to also prevent major cardiac events from reoccurring. AMR-001 has already successfully made it through Phase I trials, as outlined in a recent <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/Neostem/neostem-investor-powerpoint-august-2011-9071305?ref=http://www.neostem.com/investor-relations/"">company presentation</a>, and the first patient has already enrolled in the ongoing PreSERVE Phase II trial. Results from the PreSERVE trial are expected to start rolling in during the latter half of 2013, at which time the NBS share price could appreciate quite significantly, if results are positive.</p><p>Additionally, NeoStem has a large-scale contract manufacturing facility under its belt to provide the growing company with a revenue stream as it develops its pipeline. In a deal completed in early 2011, Neostem landed <a href=""http://pctcelltherapy.com/"">Progenitor Cell Therapy</a> and revenue from this division has already led to a growth rate of 95% during the past two reporting quarters, according to numbers presented the latest quarterly <a href=""http://www.nasdaq.com/article/neostem-announces-quarterly-results-and-business-update-20120814-00182"">report</a>. The fact that Neostem has PCT in its arsenal gives it an additional leg up on other companies in the sector and adds the prospect that the company's share price could also move based on revenue growth related to that division.</p><p>While dips in the share prices of developmental companies is common following quick moves higher, Neostem, like those companies mentioned above, has enough going for it that investors have reason to believe that any current dip could ultimately result in a rebound - if the pipeline progresses accordingly.</p><p><strong>Sunshine Heart (SSH)</strong><strong>:</strong> The volatile Sunshine Heart <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-sunshine-heart-moving-on-positive-analyst-coverage-and-pending-catalysts"">spiked hard</a> following the initiation of positive analyst coverage a couple of weeks ago, but a couple of down days this week - including a five percent Wednesday drop - has returned prices to near the value of a recent public <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-weekly-stock-watch-week-of-13-august-amrn-mric-sppi-ssh-imsc-bsx-alth-si-cpst-ttnp-cvm"">offering</a>. Value was not notable during the decline in price, but as noted in relation to the companies listed above, the drop may be more attributed to the overall trend of seeing traders bail out with profits following quick spikes in price.</p><p>Also like the above-mentioned companies, however, Sunshine may have enough going for it over the short to mid term that investors may consider the current dip as a temporary one. The company has devised the C-Pulse Heart Assist system, a medical device that has thus far proven to halt - and possibly reverse - the effects and progression of heart failure in patients with Class III and ambulatory Class IV heart failure. It's also considered less-intrusive than other heart-implantable devices since it is implanted outside of the blood stream, was <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sunshine-heart-announces-ce-mark-for-c-pulser-heart-assist-system-2012-07-25"">approved</a> in Europe just months ago, and has also demonstrated positive results in an already-completed North American feasibility study. As a result of these results, Sunshine plans to launch a US trial within months - a milestone that could coincide with the first commercial sales of C-Pulse in Europe.</p><p>The above-mentioned stock offering positions Sunshine to last comfortably through the mid-way point of the US trial, a key milestone where mid-term results could provide a solid catalyst. Should C-Pulse look to be returning the positive results of earlier trials, that's a point where potential partners and additional investors could look to make a move. Given the wording contained within an <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1506492/000104746912007914/a2210271zs-1a.htm"">amended S1</a> following the aforementioned stock offering, it could be speculated that such an event is possible. According to the S1, a major &quot;strategic investor&quot; was looking to come on board during the offering and it was also noted that the investor would also send an &quot;observer&quot; to the Sunshine board. Such actions are indicative of a firm or potential acquiring company looking to take a &quot;<span>wait </span>and see&quot; approach regarding the upcoming trial before jumping all-in. Again, the mid-way point of the trial would be an ideal place for such an investor to reevaluate the way-ahead.</p><p>Sunshine has proven highly volatile over the summer months, initially spiking to over seventeen dollars from three, and then playing the peaks and valleys game a couple of more times leading into this latest dip. Still considered highly speculative, Sunshine shares are susceptible to trading swings such as those already seen, at least until the company can generate meaningful revenue. It's also been demonstrated, however, that SSH is often a good bet to rebound off current lows, making any protracted dip here a possible buying scenario in preparation for either another trade or simply a hold for the long haul as C-Pulse is commercialized in Europe and the US trial gains steam.</p><p><strong>Roundup:</strong> Many believe the broad markets are positioning for a downturn, judging by the tone of recent financial outlet headlines. Given that mood, traders sitting on hefty profits following the runs of the summer months that led to the markets sitting at multi-year highs may be convinced that the time is now to bank some profits and boost the cash reserves on the sidelines. Such actions will inherently lead to the volatility we're seeing in many stocks, but it could also lead to some buying opportunities as many times the stories and pipelines behind the dropping share prices haven't changed. It's highly unlikely that we'll see a market dip as exasperated as we've seen at points over the past five years, but any time the market dips - it's always a good idea to have some cash reserves on the sidelines to jump into any good buys that may materialize. The five above-mentioned companies are just a fraction of what's out there - but they may end up performing a lot better than replacement NFL refs over time.</p><p>Happy <span>Trading</span>!</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[AMRN]].

"625641","2012-05-30 09:54:10","Hyper-Novel Investments For Targeting Cancer","<p>Cancer treatment advances over the last decade have been phenomenal with great success in fighting a host of different cancers. Improvements have been made in surgical, chemotherapy and radiation treatment procedures to improve efficacy as well as the treatments' safety profiles. For many tumors and cancerous tissues, surgery and radiation are often not valid options due to associated risks. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents have improved dramatically with each having their good and bad points. Chemotherapy is often the more efficous of the two, however the very nature of the drug that enables it to kill cancer cells also weakens and kills healthy tissue along with it. The cytotoxic nature of the drugs often requires reduced dosages to avoid systemic side effects, but the reduced dosages more often than not means reduced efficacy. Immunotherapy treatments are progressing rapidly as evident of approvals in the last three years of Dendreon's Provenge and Bristol-Meyers Squibb's Yervoy. However, many trials underway are of an adjuvant nature rather than a first-line treatment in which the therapies utilize the patients' immunity system to fight residual and newly-formed cancer cells after a more potent first-line treatment performs the initial eradication.</p><p>Equally important as the types of chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents chosen, the methods of administration can impact the outcome of a treatment regimen. If these agents can be injected into and around the targeted tumors and tissue, their efficacy can be enhanced dramatically. However, the patient's circulatory system still carries the agents throughout their body which has a diluting effect on the treatment's efficacy and multiplies the agent's side effects. Following are some small pharmaceuticals with seemingly solid and novel approaches to administering differing chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents. It is interesting to note that there aren't as many legitimate approaches as one might think, as an internet search indicates. Investors should consider the market capitalizations of the companies mentioned, the flexibility of their product line to switch indications and utilized agents in case current indications fail, and their current pipeline progression and potential matched against the market caps. For example, is a more advanced <span>Phase III trial worth 30 times the market cap of a comparable <span>Phase I or <span>Phase II company?</p><p><strong>Delcath's (DCTH)</strong> share structure was recently diluted again after a public offering of 13.3 million shares at a 37% discount to that day's closing price for a total of about $20 million dollars after warrants. Investors already having a position in the common stock are now faced with depression of their own holdings as the stock price will likely suffer unless a solid catalyst arrives in the short term. With no product marketed in the U.S. but yet a <a href=""http://www.delcath.com/news-events/news/article/reuters/1680420/"">CE Mark approval</a> to their credit, a $100 million plus market capitalization (value is variable with volatility and offering amount) may still seem expensive for this company. The company had its <a href=""http://www.delcath.com/news-events/news/article/reuters/1531019/"">NDA rejected</a> for metastatic melanoma of the liver in February 2011 sending the stock into a plunge it has yet to recover from. Delcath plans to resubmit the NDA in August of this year after substantial data analysis with final preparations now underway according to a recent company <a href=""http://www.delcath.com/news-events/news/article/reuters/1693428/"">press release</a>.</p><p>Delcath's CHEMOSTAT drug delivery system is a simple but rather novel approach to treating cancer tumors. The technology requires the affected organ to be isolated from the rest of the patient's circulatory system via balloon catheters which are inserted and inflated thereby preventing blood flow into or out of the affected organ. A high dose of the chemotherapy drug, melphalan, (in the case of the liver cancer treatment regimen) is infused into the inferior vena cava through a catheter in the femoral vein. The agent is routed directly into the affected liver where it is resides for 30 minutes at the highly concentrated dose. The chemotherapy-saturated blood is then collected and filtered to remove the agent via an external filter. The patient's blood is then returned to his body through a catheter in the jugular vein. The procedure allows a highly concentrated and therefore more efficous dosage of the chemotherapy agent at the tumor site while preventing the systemic exposure by isolation, purification and then reintroduction of the purified blood to the patient's circulatory system. The procedure is a bit involving and does require specialized training to perfect, and the system already has a rejected NDA behind it. It still remains to be seen as to the decision by the FDA to allow marketing of the product and what kind of time frame is really going to be involved. If the company does indeed reapply for NDA in August, it will be 18 months since the NDA was initially applied for. This is a suspiciously-long period for &quot;<em>information involving manufacturing plant inspection timing, product and sterilization validations and additional safety information that we already planned on filing with our 120 day safety update in April, as well as additional statistical analysis clarification</em>&quot; as was stated by the CEO as the <a href=""http://www.delcath.com/news-events/news/article/reuters/1531019/"">reasons for the rejection</a>.</p><p><strong>OncoSec Medical, Inc. (</strong><a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/oncs.ob""><strong>ONCS.OB</strong></a><strong>)</strong> has a novel approach to target cancer tumors while reducing systemic exposure. Rather than focusing solely on utilizing chemotherapy drugs as their choice agents, OncoSec is using an electroporation technique through its OncoSec Medical System ((OMS)) to attack cancerous tumors and tissues through their OMS ElectroChemotherapy or OMS ElectroImmunotherapy methods. Electroporation is a process in which a brief electric current is applied across a cell which causes a temporary but significant increase in the cell membrane's porosity. This increased porosity causes a stimulated cancer cell to be much more susceptible to chemotherapy or immunotherapy agent's affects. For this treatment protocol, a chemotherapy or immunotherapy agent is injected into the targeted tumor(s). An electric current is applied via the OMS which dramatically increases the uptake of the agent into the cells' interior where it is intended to work. The electric current is then removed, and the cells' membranes return to their original state trapping the agent inside the drug.</p><p>The rapidly-absorbed cancer agents are beneficial for many reasons. First, the efficacy is highly enhanced as the treated cells have an increase of 1000 times the porosity of the cells in their non-stimulated state which allows for rapid uptake into the cells where the agents do their work. Secondly, if the agents are tied up inside the cancer tissue and nearby margin tissue, then they are not circulating throughout the body where systemic toxicity and other issues might come into play. These two points come into play in virtually all chemotherapy and some immunotherapy drugs in which the higher dosages necessary to have good efficacy often mean a less desirable safety profile. Thirdly, in the case of agents that have very high costs associated with their use, the use of the OMS systems can greatly reduce the amount of agent required in order to have the same efficacy as their traditional application mechanism. This quickly comes into play for a highly efficous but expensive agent of choice. Theoretically speaking, 1000 times the porosity likely means 1000 times less agent to use than traditionally required? Okay, let's be more reasonable and say &quot;only&quot; 500 times less? With the potential for success in either its immunotherapy or chemotherapy approaches, a current $9.8 million mark could be to be highly undervalued relative to its peers.</p><p><strong>Oncolytics Biotech, Inc (ONCY)</strong> has a very unique approach to fighting cancer. It utilizes a proprietary formulation of the human reovirus named REOLYSIN. The company is utilizing the technology in varied indications thus far with its lead trial being a <span>Phase III trial for head and neck cancer. Although not specifically targeting a single tumor, the technology is interesting and applicable here. The primary mechanism that REOLYSIN works by is via &quot;infecting&quot; and replicating inside of cancer cells exhibiting a so-called activated ras pathway, seen in about two thirds of all cancers. Once inside these cells and replication begins, the cells undergo an apoptosis event by rupturing which releases the viruses to infect and destroy other cells. Normal cells are supposedly not affected by the virus. An interesting side event occurring is the body's response to the ruptured cells. When the cancer cells rupture and its fragments are released into the blood, the antigens are &quot;presented&quot; to the immunity system which responds by attacking them with T cells and natural killer cells. The antigens presented, which in many cancers is specific to that cancer, &quot;teach&quot; the immunity system what the cancer cells &quot;look&quot; like and an immune response is generated targeting not only the cancer cell pieces left from the REOLYSIN-triggered apoptosis, but other cancer cells left in the body with the same antigen signature. According to the company, this immune response can persist for months after the virus is eliminated from the patient's body.</p><p>The company certainly has a <a href=""http://www.oncolyticsbiotech.com/clinical-trials"">deep pipeline</a> with a novel approach which could give an investor a large return on investment even with its current $292 million market capitalization, the largest of the three companies discussed here. The company has also been using its novel therapy with good success as its deep and varied pipeline and market capitalization indicate. The therapy is being used as a monotherapy and in conjunction with several chemotherapy agents with good success seen in this area also, thus giving the treatment the diversity of treatment indications as well as chemotherapy agents utilized to make it one of the three &quot;hyper novel&quot; therapies profiled.</p><p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p><p>Seen above are three small pharmaceutical companies with novel approaches to targeting cancer cells via chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy agents. The three companies profiled are all construed as &quot;development <span>Phase&quot; with only Delcath having a marketed product and there only in Europe where it just received its first commercial order in March, almost a year after receiving CE Mark approval. The company is also having problems with the FDA with one NDA rejection and slow resubmission of the NDA despite earlier statements by the CEO indicating the NDA resubmission would be in Q3 and then Q4 2011. The date has now been moved to Q3 2012.</p><p>Oncolytics seems to be exploring all avenues with several indications in clinicals with monotherapy approaches and synergistic chemotherapy trials underway. However, one avenue that has been overlooked is fairly critical. IF there is an issue with the safety profile of REOLYSIN in any form, although apparently not likely or anticipated, this would be hugely disruptive of virtually their entire pipeline with their &quot;all the eggs in one basket&quot; approach to their pipeline being totally centered around REOLYSIN. The reward of success for shareholders is good even with the highest market capitalization of the three profiled companies. However, the risk of the entire clinical pipeline being put on hold because of a questionable safety profile in any trial or worst yet an obvious safety problem which could affect the company's entire pipeline.</p><p>Earlier in its development than Oncolytics or Delcath, OncoSec has been making good progress. Its pipeline is using a multi-faceted approach with the technology utilizing chemotherapy and immunotherapy through its OMS ElectroChemotherapy and OMS ElectroImmunotherapy technologies. Although early in trials and with only limited agents used thus far (Bleomycin for the former and interleukin-12 or IL-12 for the latter), the options are virtually unlimited utilizing both already approved agents to perhaps speed up the approval process or highly efficous agents with a questionable safety profile that may be muted due to the much lower levels required utilizing the electroporation process. The market capitalization should be also considered for investment consideration as the $9.8 million value is 10 times less than Delcath's and about 30 times less than Oncolytics' valuation. OncoSec's pipeline is not as advanced as the other two, however the upside is much greater and downside likely much less than either of the other two.</p><p>This is the pharmaceutical sector and anything is possible with problems stemming from many areas of product development sneaking in and disrupting an investor's entire game plan. Conversely, surprise approvals, phenomenal clinical data, licensing deals, development suitors or buyers materializing from seemingly nowhere can positively affect the companies' and their shareholders' future.

The drop was not supported by  any developments on the news front, but could have been attributed to  some lingering short interest and a slump in the biotech/pharmaceutical  sector as a whole following <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.blogspot.com/2011/08/dndn-blood-bath-could-immunocellulars.html"">dismal news</a> from the likes of Dendreon (DNDN), Ilumina (ILMN) and Human Genome Sciences (HGSI) over the past few months. <img src=""http://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2011/10/17/saupload_ampe.jpg"" align=""right"" hspace=""6"" vspace=""6"" width=""330"" /></p><p>The AMPE rebound, on the other hand, goes hand in hand with the progress of the company's pipeline.</p><p>As previously discussed, Ampio has been making headway in bringing  Zertane to market around the globe for the treatment of sexual  dysfunction.  Following positive Phase III trial results which were <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/290958-ampio-rebounds-as-study-results-published-in-europe"">published in Europe</a> this summer, Ampio secured a <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.blogspot.com/2011/09/ampio-pharmaceuticals-on-roll-with-new.html"">partnership and licensing deal</a> with Daewoong Pharmaceuticals, which puts the commercialization plan in motion as the rest of the pipeline develops.</p><p>Next up is lead product Ampion, for which a late stage trial in  Australia measuring its effect in osteoarthritis ((OA)) in the knee has  been underway.  An <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Ampio-Pharmaceuticals-Inc-prnews-169357861.html?x=0&amp;.v=1"">announcement</a>  last week revealed that the treatment phase Ampion-in-Knee ((AIK)) trial  has been completed and that data is going to be compiled and released in  the &quot;coming weeks.&quot;</p><p>The trial was composed of sixty patients diagnosed with  moderately-severe to severe osteoarthritis of the knee and any success  here could ignite a series of events that catapults Ampion straight into  the heart of an $80 billion anti-inflammatory and autoimmune disease  market.  Alternatives to common anti-inflammatories are being searched  for in the medical community due to concerns of side effects, and an  Ampion thrust into that market could come relatively quickly given its  status as a biologic - a molecule already produced by the human body (as  albumin) and an already-established safety profile.</p><p>These results mark another key development for Ampio this year, and the  coming weeks could see additional interest drawn to the company stock  given the Ampion news.</p><p>Additionally, Ampio also <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Ampio-Announces-the-prnews-271995893.html?x=0&amp;.v=1"">announced</a>  last week that information and data from Ampion development is set to  be presented at San Fransisco's American Association of Orthopedic  Surgery ((AAOS)) meeting this coming February.

Results could come by the end of  the year for an Optina trial as well, which is taking place in Canada.   Optina, another of Ampio's products based on the strategy of taking  already-approved drugs and using them to treat new indications, is being  tested as an oral drug for the treatment of diabetic macular edema  ((DME)) and diabetic retinopathy.</p><p>Optina has been repositioned from Danazol, which has already been  commercially available for years, giving it an already-established  safety profile. Those facts could greatly reduce its time-to-market  potential.</p><p>In addition to the repositioned products in the pipeline, Ampio has a  pipeline of ORP diagnostic technology being developed. Should the ORP  pipeline reach the approval stages and infiltrate the routine and  critical care markets, the standard of how a patient's vital signs are  measured could be shifted. Rather than using the routine standards of  today's methods of checking for vital signs, Ampio's ORP diagnostic  device measures total oxidative stress, which may prove more beneficial  and thorough for patients being seen for indications such as heart  attack and stroke.  Abnormal ORP results are closely associated with  poor outcomes in critically ill patients, which offers a wide scope of  potential applications should this device receive regulatory approval.   Clinical studies for the ORP device are ongoing, and well worth watching  for updates.</p><p>Ampio opened the month on a downtrend, but the brief dip into the fives  was quickly reversed, and the developing stories surrounding Ampion and  Zertane provide the ammunition to support growing interest to this  company.</p><p>All products in the Ampio pipeline are being positioned to enter very  lucrative markets, so this is a company whose stock has been on the rise  that still could have more to come.</p><p><strong>Disclosure</strong>:  Long AMPE.</p>"
"847551","2012-09-05 13:16:06","Starbucks Adding Stevia To Their Energy Drinks May Be A Boost For Stevia Growers","<p>Starbucks (SBUX), the world's largest coffeehouse chain, recently threw its hat into the $8 billion energy drink market when it unveiled its own energy drink, Refreshers. Refreshers, which come in three flavors, raspberry pomegranate, orange melon, and strawberry lemonade, joins a crowded <a href=""http://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/12/04/2511210/battle-of-energy-drink-brands-coca-cola-vs-monster"">market</a> dominated by Red Bull GmbH, Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST) (formally Hansen's Natural), Coca-Cola's (KO) Full Throttle, and PepsiCo's (PEP) AMP and <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/29283353/Pepsi_Deal_Will_Rock_The_Energy_Drink_Aisle"">Rockstar</a>, which they distribute for Rockstar, Inc. While most energy drinks contain the same base <a href=""http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/energy-drink.htm"">ingredients</a><span> - </span>carbonated water, citric acid, corn syrup, sodium, fruit juice, guarana, taurine, ginseng, caffeine, and sugar<span> -</span> Starbucks is taking a different approach. They're going low cal, natural, and they're going green-- green coffee extract that is. Caffeine and ginseng are what gives Refreshers its boost. The other ingredients are natural: carbonated water, fruit juice, and a natural zero calorie sweetener called stevia.</p><p>Stevia, a leafy plant native to Paraguay, has made loud rumbles as of late as the hottest natural zero calorie sweetener to hit the scene. Stevia is actually the entire plant, but it's the steviol glycoside found only in the leaves that are sweet. It is the steviol glycoside, which is <span>then</span> isolated and purified, that has been approved by the FDA as <em>Generally Recognized As Safe</em> (<a href=""http://www.steviabenefits.org/regulatorystatus.html"">GRAS</a>) for its use as a general purpose sweetener. There are a number of different steviol glycosides, but the one that is the focus of extraction is Rebaudioside A (Reb A), which is anywhere from <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=VIP04mz7MTQC%26pg=PA344%26lpg=PA344%26dq=rebaudioside+a+sweetness%26source=bl%26ots=jqvfOrXGso%26sig=wnwTThTVowVUKHStD2N3x2cscYY%26hl=en%26sa=X%26ei=S54qUJXWI8HJiwLP1oGgBw%26ved=0CF8Q6AEwBDgK"">250 to 450</a> times sweeter than sucrose, depending on the plant. Being the first company to use stevia in an energy drink, Starbucks may have tapped into a segment of the market that has been ignored: consumers who want a <em>natural</em> low calorie energy drink. <a href=""http://magazine.foxnews.com/food-wellness/starbucks-refreshers"">Cliff Burrows</a>, president of Starbucks Americas, described the product as &quot;an innovative extension of the coffee market,&quot; and &quot;the perfect solution for customers looking for a boost of natural energy and thirst-quenching, delicious refreshment.&quot;</p><p>What is surprising is that Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Monster all have products on the market that are sweetened with stevia. Coca-Cola, the Atlanta based beverage giant, and Cargill <a href=""http://www2.qsrmagazine.com/articles/features/108/sugar-free-1.phtml"">filed 24 US patents</a> relating to stevia; and in 2008, the FDA approved Truvia, a Reb A sweetener developed jointly by the two companies. Coca-Cola has added Truvia to over 30 products around the world, including Diet Coke in Japan, and Sprite and Nestea beverages in France. Cargill markets Truvia to consumers in sugar packs and is now the number 2 sweetener behind Splenda. PepsiCo developed a competing stevia based product, PureVia, jointly with The Whole Earth Sweetener Company. PureVia can be found in Sobe Lifewater and Trop50, Tropicana's fruit juice beverages. Monster sweetens their Hansen's diet sodas with stevia. If Starbucks Refreshers become a hit, it would only make sense for the other beverage companies to rush in and add stevia to their diet energy drink line.</p><p>How does one invest in the growing stevia market? At this time, none of the major beverage companies are involved in the actual growing of stevia plants. They leave that up to small growers predominately in China and Vietnam. So the question is: Will these small farms in Asia be able to supply the growing stevia demand without sacrificing quality? Probably not, but that all may be changing as a handful of U.S. companies have seen the potential in growing high grade stevia on (and in) U.S. soil. It is with these micro-cap companies where an investor may cash in on the stevia boom.</p><p>Stevia First Corp. (STVF.OB) may have jumped ahead of the pack last week when it announced that the company has entered into an exclusive and worldwide intellectual property <a href=""http://www.steviafirst.com/news/news_releases/2012/08/stevia-first-corp.-licenses-fermentation-based-stevia-intellectual-property-from-vineland-research-and-innovation-centre"">license</a> with the Vineland Research and Innovation Center of Ontario, Canada. According to Stevia First Corp., the license encompasses compositions and methods for producing steviol and steviol glycosides through fermentation-based production methods. In addition to the license, Stevia First has entered into a separate consulting agreement with Vineland to assist with further development of the underlying intellectual property.</p><p>What makes this announcement significant is that currently it is estimated that 70% or more of the cost of stevia extract is directly attributable to the cost of stevia leaf production. Because the stevia leaf contains small quantities of Reb A, complex extraction and purification processes must be used, adding to the cost. Researchers at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada were among the first to discover and characterize the natural biochemical pathways that are involved in the production of Reb A; thus it has become possible to produce stevia extract through fermentation-based technologies. These methods are capable of converting low-cost plant materials into sweet steviol glycosides through controlled fermentation methods, a process that could bypass or significantly diminish the need for stevia leaf production. Vineland currently controls intellectual property related to this technology. Robert Brooke, Stevia First Corp.'s CEO, commented on the licensing agreement, &quot;In the stevia industry, which has grown tremendously over the past several years, there is still significant unmet demand from multinational companies for a supply chain that can consistently produce great-tasting stevia extract in large quantities. The technology we've licensed represents a potential solution for this need, and one that our scientific team is eager to commercialize.&quot;</p><p>Stevia First is a micro-cap development stage company based in Yuba City, CA with a market cap of $15.7 million. It recently leased 1000 acres of fertile farm land in the central valley of CA for developing and planting strains high in Reb A. That, along with their licensing agreement with Vineland, should make Stevia First a good long term bet at a minimum, even though the company has no sales to date. The company has enhanced its original business model from the seed, to production, to sale, and all is under its control. By signing the licensing agreement with Vineland, Stevia First Corp. is no longer a one dimensional company.</p><p>There are other stevia development companies out there, like Indianapolis based Stevia Corp. (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/stev.ob""><span>STEV.OB</span></a>), which recently announced a joint venture agreement with <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/stevia-corp-closes-joint-venture-and-technology-agreement-with-launch-of-stevia-technew-limited-2012-07-17"">Tech-New Bio-Technology</a> and their affiliates, resulting in technology and intellectual property transfers and the creation of Stevia TechNew Limited, a Hong Kong-registered company. TechNew was founded in 2008 and currently services more than 200 aquaculture farms in China. Stevia Corp. has also experienced its stock soar from $0.70 to a 52 week high of $2.75 when it announced the company entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement with the Ridgefield, CT institutional investor, <a href=""http://www.stevia.co/news/news_releases/2012/01/stevia-corp.-secures-20-million-in-financing"">Southridge Partners II, LP</a>, for up to $20 million of the company's shares. Shortly thereafter, the stock came back down and now sits just below $0.30 per share. The company has invested their business with growers in Vietnam and Indonesia, and though costs are far less there than in the U.S., they are also dependent on how the winds of change can blow in the foreign markets for their business to succeed. And though stevia products are clearly on the rise, the caveat in the deck with this company is whether or not they can build a good business model and a quality supply line through the Asian markets alone.</p><p>As an investor, which company might give the best bang for the buck? It has been proven over the years the success of investing in the giants, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, and that there is less volatility than the smaller growth stocks, like Starbucks and Monster. Monster, the smallest of the bottlers, has a market cap of $10.4 billion, and is trading around $57.25 a share, down from its 52 week high of $83.96 per share. It lost momentum on Aug. 8th when the company announced it missed the street estimated quarterly profits. Monster still has a very high P/E ratio for its sector at 32.08. Starbucks with $11.7 billion in <a href=""http://news.starbucks.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=583"">sales</a> last year, on the other hand, has a market cap of $37.7 billion and is trading just under $50.00 per share, also well off its 52 week high. Starbucks, with a P/E ratio of 27.43 is still considerably higher than the sector average. But Starbucks has over 9,000 company retail outlets and over 4,700 licensed stores around the world. And though Monster and Starbucks may begin to compete head to head at convenience stores and markets, Monster cannot compete with the retail coffeehouses of a Starbucks.</p><p>One other note to consider is that New York's <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444230504577615690249123150.html?KEYWORDS=Monster+energy+drink"">attorney general</a>, Eric T. Schneiderman, is investigating whether the energy drink industry is deceiving consumers with misstatements about the ingredients and health value of its products. In July, he issued subpoenas to PepsiCo Inc., Monster, and Living Essentials, LLC, maker of 5-hour Energy drink, asking for information on the companies' marketing and advertising practices. Investigators are looking into whether the addition of ingredients like guarana-another source of caffeine-violates laws that ban putting multiple sources of caffeine in one beverage without disclosing the overall amount. If energy drink makers are found to have violated certain New York state laws regulating food and drugs, they could be looking at civil fines and penalties, and would have to change their labeling and marketing. Starbucks, with their natural coffee-based Refreshers, will probably come out of this unscathed, if not given a boost. Therefore, when it comes to which beverage company may give the best return for the buck, Starbucks looks like the better long term bet of the two.</p><p>When assessing which development company appears to be the better investment one must remember they may be walking through a risky minefield, but with such risk there might be great reward. Stevia may be here to stay. In many cases, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease can be traced back to too much sugar. And artificial sweeteners made from chemicals are losing favor with the consumer. More and more companies are using stevia. If Starbucks Refreshers are successful, look for the other big beverage companies to fall in line and add stevia to their energy drink lines, which would mean a greater need for stevia growers and developers. With the announcement of the licensing agreement with Vineland Research and Innovation Center, Stevia First Corp.'s stock has risen 75% to $0.70 a share. The question is, will Stevia First Corp., with their seed development and abundant farmland, plus the positive results shown in the fermentation process, be able to position itself to be the future of stevia production? If they can, Stevia First is still a bargain.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

"590861","2012-05-15 13:39:32","Provenge And NeuVax: A Tale Of 2 Marvels","<p>With each era of discovery it seems there is always a leader with the innovative foresight and fortitude to lead a revolution and conquer a foe. The tools used to defeat the enemy are considered to be marvels and are viewed as such by outsiders willing to bask in their glory and enjoy the fruits of their successes. Meanwhile, there are always those desiring to dissect the technology, glean from it whatever knowledge is obtainable and reverse engineer it to develop their own wares from it to benefit them and their potential customer base with their own &quot;new&quot; product.</p><p>Dendreon received the <a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-approves-provenger-for-the-treatment-of-men-with-advanced-prostate-cancer-92431919.html"">FDA's approval</a> to market Provenge in April of 2010 for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic <a href=""http://www.prostate-cancer.com/prostate-cancer-glossary/hormone-refractory-prostate.html"">hormone-refractory</a> prostate cancer. Provenge is a revolutionary, first-in-class immunotherapy treatment that is designed to cause an immune response against prostatic acid phosphatase ((PAP)), an antigen that is expressed in most prostate cancers. Provenge's approval legitimized an entirely new approach to fighting cancer. Previous standards of care included resection, chemotherapy, hormone therapy and/or radiotherapy. Although each had its merits, each also had its drawbacks ranging from disfigurement, toxicities, immune system compromise and a host of secondary illnesses often due to the patients' immune system compromise. Provenge's approach works with the patients' immunity systems rather than compromising it. In a sense, it teaches the immunity system that the PAP antigen is foreign and it should be attacked as such. The on-going battle against cancer is partly made more difficult by the fact that the body doesn't recognize the cancer cells as foreign and either ignores them, or even nourishes them, as evident by the mass of blood vessels supplying the solid tumors of some cancers.</p><p>Provenge was revolutionary in the respect that it ushered in a whole new era of cancer treatment. Since its approval, other companies have attempted to put their spin on the technology with clinicals underway to treat a host of other cancers. Galena Biopharma (GALE) has been one of the most successful of these with its NeuVax therapy to treat breast cancer. While applying the same immunotherapy concept to work using the patient's own immunity system to fight the disease, NeuVax is indeed a next generation treatment relative to Provenge. No degree of disrespect is meant for what Provenge has done to the field of cancer treatment and for the hope it gives the intended prostate cancer patient set. It was and still is a marvel and a revolutionary treatment regimen, and Dendreon will likely continue to make millions on it. Additional research and perfecting of Dendreon's methodology was inevitable as with any technology and Galena looks to be taking full advantage of the immunotherapy evolution.</p><p>The NeuVax vaccine consists of the E75 peptide derived from the HER2 protein which is found on about 75% of breast cancers and a host of other cancers. The vaccine is combined with the immune adjuvant granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). When injected intradermally, NeuVax stimulates cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in a highly specific manner to target cells expressing HER2. The <a href=""http://investors.galenabiopharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=641187""><span>Phase III PRESENT trial</a> for NeuVax initiated enrollment earlier this year and is focusing on breast cancer patients with low to moderate (HER2 +1 and +2) levels of the HER2 expression. This part of the HER2 breast cancer patient set comprises about 50% of breast cancers and represents an unmet need as the highly expressed (HER2 +3) set is currently treated with the $5 billion per year revenue-generating Herceptin produced by Roche-Genentech (RHHBY).</p><p>While NeuVax and Provenge each are both immunotherapy drugs with staunch investor followings, the two are very different in terms of mechanisms, preparation, targeted patient set, parent companies and other characteristics. Prostate and breast cancers each have huge unmet needs in society. Each has several degrees of progression, sub-types and prognoses beyond the scope of the article. To give an over-simplified comparison, the Center for Disease Control's website for <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/Features/CancerStatistics/"">cancer statistics</a> can be consulted. Although not a breakdown of the many sub-types of each cancer, it does convey the prevalence of the diseases and their need for a cure. Their latest reported composite data from <a href=""http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2009_pops09/results_merged/topic_prevcounts.pdf"">SEER</a>, NPCR and NCI from 2007 reported an age-adjusted 156.9 newly-reported cases of prostate cancer and 120.4 newly-reported cases of breast cancers per 100,000 people. To put the unmet need in perspective, however, the number of deaths is more relevant. The same website reports an ominous 23.5 age-adjusted deaths for overall prostate cancer and 22.8 age-adjusted deaths for breast cancer (breast cancer data is for women only) per 100,000 patients, both unacceptable numbers for a developed country with about 310 million citizens. Provenge's approval is only for the metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate, but these numbers weren't specifically available. NeuVax's initial indication is expected to target HER2 +1 and +2 expressions or 50% of breast cancer cases.</p><p>NeuVax and Provenge differ radically in their manufacturing and administrations. Provenge is an autologous vaccine. It is derived from and manufactured from cells extracted from the patient to be treated. The process is slow, labor- intensive, involves many steps (many steps could mean more areas for potential manufacturing problems and contamination) and lastly, expensive. Steps of its production require blood withdrawal and subsequent leukapheresis, a process in which the white blood cells (containing antigen-presenting cells) are separated from the sample. These cells are then packaged and shipped to one of Dendreon's manufacturing facilities. These cells are then co-cultured with prostatic acid phosphatase ((PAP))-containing recombinant fusion protein. PAP is used because it is over-expressed on 95% of prostate cancers, a solid antigen target. The end product of the process is PAP linked to GM-CSF, a vaccine that teaches T cells and other immune system components to target and destroy the PAP expression cells. The manufacturing process takes two days, and the patient can receive his first treatment approximately 3 days after his blood was collected. The treatment regimen consists of 3 dosages infused over the period of 4 weeks.</p><p>NeuVax is an off-the-shelf or allogeneic drug and not made &quot;as needed&quot;. The therapy is readily available and ready for immediate administration upon diagnosis and subsequent standard of care treatment of resection, radiotherapy or chemotherapy (or some combination thereof). After this first-line treatment, NeuVax is administered once per month for six months as part of its initial regimen. Patients would then receive additional doses once every six months as boosters to keep the patients' immune system responses strong. The off-the-shelf preparation is key for NeuVax as it contributes to keeping the cost of the drug low relative to Provenge's $31K per infusion or $93K for the three-treatment regimen. Preliminary costs for NeuVax meanwhile are $1000 per dose. Dendreon did have sluggish initial sales partly due to the cost of the drug and reimbursement issues with the administering physicians paying for the therapy up front and having to await payment from insurance. At first, <a href=""http://www.pharmalot.com/2011/03/medicare-decides-provenge-can-be-reimbursed/"">Medicare even balked</a> at the treatment cost. However, many of those issues have now been resolved and the revenue stream has begun to increase.</p><p>Provenge's 2010 approval was based on a 512 patient set double-blind placebo-controlled <span>Phase III trial in which median overall survival increased 4.1 months to 25.8 months versus 21.7 months for patients receiving the placebo, an apparently marginal efficacy depending on vantage point. Subsequent data analysis of the trial data has given a more positive spin on the data, but nothing official about these analyses has been released from Dendreon. Upcoming ASCO presentations and real-world data acquisition of the patients treated since the drug has been marketed should shine some light on the efficacy in the coming months. NeuVax's <span>Phase III trial initiated in January, so no data is yet available for it (likely Q1 2013). The <span>Phase II data, for which the trial design is based on, had a 53 patient subset receiving at least one booster inoculation (once every six months) with impressive efficacy as evident in a statistically significant disease-free survival rate of 95.9% versus 79.7% in the control group (p = 0.016). To keep things in perspective, Provenge is used as a first-line treatment with a much more difficult job to accomplish in attacking the tumor itself. NeuVax, has a theoretically easier job of attacking residual or newly-formed HER2 +1/+2 expressed cells/tumors in an adjuvant setting after the initial standard of care treatment to shrink and remove the cancer initially. NeuVax is intended to prevent recurrence while Provenge fights on the front lines.</p><p>Lastly is the all-important aspect of safety, as efficacy with a less-than-acceptable safety profile means little. Provenge's autologous preparation should be a safety benefit as the treatment is manufactured from the patients' own cells. This should greatly reduce any immune system rejection of the therapy. The FDA approval <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm210174.htm"">announcement</a> did mention some issues with the safety profile despite the therapy's acceptance. Virtually all patients receiving Provenge had an adverse reaction of some kind. The majority of the reactions were mild or moderate in severity and included chills, fatigue, fever, back pain, nausea, joint ache and headache. Serious adverse events were reported in on quarter of the patients with some acute infusion reactions and stroke. Cerebrovascular events, including hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes, were noted in 3.5 percent of patients compared to 2.6 percent of patients in the control group. Conversely, the NeuVax <span>Phase II patient set with all patients passing the 3 year landmark has had an extremely promising safety profile with no serious adverse events reported. The most commonly reported treatment-related issues in the combined node-positive and node-negative trials were redness, induration at the injection site, erythema, pruritis, or discomfort requiring medication. The most common systemic toxicities were bone pain, flu-like symptoms, fatigue, headache, and myalgias (attributed to GM-CSF and short in duration). Most toxicities in the two studies combined were mild (Grade 1 or 2). Three Grade 3 events of bone pain, back pain, and angioedema, and no Grade 4 or 5 AEs were reported. A NeuVax/Provenge comparison for safety shows a clear advantage to NeuVax at this point. However, when comparing either to the side effects associated with the typical chemotherapy regimen, the winner in either case is the targeted patient set.</p><p>Dendreon has solidified its position in the pharmaceutical sector with its revolutionary and first-in-class method of attacking cancer through an immunotherapy approach. It has now gone beyond development <span>Phase and is now marketing its product and generating revenue to the tune of $82 million in Q1 2012 compared to $27 million for the same quarter in 2011, a sure sign of the drug's increasing popularity and stream-lined cost reimbursement program. The therapy is still expensive to manufacture and does affect the company's bottom line with a net loss of $103.9 million for Q1. Hopefully the company can streamline its manufacturing process and reduce the costs over the coming years making it more advantageous for the company and its patients. With a $1.40 billion dollar market capitalization and $559.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, as well as short-term and long-term investments, the company does need to continue to improve in that regard as it marches toward profitability.</p><p>Galena Biopharma is still in development stage with <span>Phase III interim data in about a year that will be highly indicative of what could be in store for the final <span>Phase III results and the company's future. With a $75 million market capitalization, the upside for investors could be substantial with a huge potential patient set as evident by Herceptin's $5 billion in sales for its portion of the HER2 patient set. The <span>Phase II trial performed as it intended with safety and efficacy determined, especially for the booster dose portion of the trial. As the anticipation of the interim <span>Phase III results will begin to grow in the coming months, more investors will likely begin hedging their bets on the upcoming data. Almost as revealing, however, will be the 48-month follow up to the <span>Phase I/II NeuVax trial at ASCO. Confirmation of the booster-set portion of the trial will further confirm the trial design of the <span>Phase III now underway and will give investors even more reason to take heed along with potential Big Pharma suitors.</p><p>Dendreon's stock still has some potential upside if ongoing trial data impresses, along with data collected from patients treated since the 2010 approval. The greater upside between the two will likely be with Galena as ASCO updates are fast approaching in early June, the <span>Phase II trial initiates in partnership with Genentech/Roche where NeuVax will be used in conjunction with Herceptin (and the obvious rumors starting to emerge about the Galena/Roche relationship), and the likely run up by the end of 2012 with the PRESENT interim data approaching. The mere anticipation of these catalysts should be chart movers while positive data will accentuate the upside even more so. The immunotherapy approach to fighting cancer has been validated thanks to Provenge. Galena Biopharma and cancer sufferers owe a great deal of thanks and respect to Dendreon for paving the way. Now, the next generation of the immunotherapy approach is emerging hopefully with better safety profiles and efficacy. There will be many variations on the theme of immunotherapy treatment of cancer with many failures and few successes likely. Time will only tell in which group Galena Biopharma will be part of. If ongoing and upcoming data confirm the 52 patient subset and its apparent success with the NeuVax boosters keeping the efficacy strong, breast cancer sufferers and company shareholders have a great deal of hope coming. 2012 and 2013 will be very telling times in the history of each of these modern immunotherapy wonders.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.</p>"
"687261","2012-06-27 10:42:32","ImmunoCellular: Cancer Is Smart, But Could An Experimental Cancer Vaccine Be Smarter?","<p>Many approaches to cancer treatment sound good in theory and can even show early clinical promise, but the odds are typically stacked against them in later-stage studies. An important reason for the dicey odds of success in cancer-drug development was <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/17/cancer-glaxo-melanoma-idUSL1E8GGS2C20120517"">recently</a> articulated by ASCO president, Dr. Sandra Swain: &quot;We know cancers are smart,&quot; she said, explaining that cancers tend to find other ways of growing and spreading when one pathway is blocked.</p><p>As much as the smart, evasive nature of cancer is a challenge, however, it also provides a clue as to which approaches could be most successful at treating it. Since many cancers utilize multiple pathways at once, defeating it requires simultaneously blocking as many of those pathways as possible. Treatment regimens designed to inhibit multiple pathways at once are, therefore, highly promising in theory, and a number have also shown promise in practice. Earlier this month, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/17/cancer-glaxo-melanoma-idUSL1E8GGS2C20120517"">presented</a> encouraging data from a small Phase I study of a combination therapy designed to target two pathways implicated in melanoma, BRAF and MEK.</p><p>Combination therapies seem to be such an intuitive solution to the problems of effective cancer treatment that it's easy to wonder why they aren't more common.</p><p>The simplified reason is that the benefits of combining drugs also come with the risks of the combined side-effects, which require careful regulatory evaluation, and often are too great to take in patients who are already sick.</p><p>The ideal cancer treatment, then, would be a single drug with multiple targets and a favorable safety profile - preferably one that would allow it to be combined with other drugs. Los Angeles-based ImmunoCellular Therapeutics (IMUC) has one such drug in clinicals, and based on current data and a number of upcoming milestones, this small company is on the verge of making some big waves. While their therapy isn't designed to target pathways, it is designed to target multiple antigens. This is important as it increases the number of cancers it can potentially target, and it enables the therapy to continue working in the event that the antigen expression changes for a specific cancer being treated.</p><p>IMUC is focused on the development of cancer vaccines that target and destroy malignant cells by harnessing the patient's native immune system, which makes them inherently safer than small molecules. Unlike other immunotherapy companies though, IMUC is pursuing a polyvalent strategy that, thanks to its proprietary vaccine technology, allows its products to target multiple cancer antigens at once.</p><p>Early-stage clinical data indicate that this strategy is working. In a Phase I study in 16 patients with the deadly brain cancer glioblastoma multiforme ((GBM)), IMUC's lead cancer vaccine candidate, ICT-107, combined with current standard of care, <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/667581-immunotherapy-comes-of-age-at-asco-2012"">demonstrated</a> a three-year progression-free survival rate of 38.5%. Three patients have now lived four years free of disease, and one an almost unheard of five years. The sample size is small, but considering GBM patients have only a 6% chance of surviving three years disease-free with standard of care alone, these findings should not be dismissed.</p><p>A larger Phase II trial is now underway, with completion of enrollment expected this quarter, and final data anticipated by the fourth quarter of 2013. At this year's ASCO, the company announced that it has already <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/instablog/200555-qualitystocks/603171-immunocellular-therapeutics-ltd-imuc-updates-on-clinical-activity-and-patient-enrollment-for-study-of-brain-cancer-vaccine-candidate"">enrolled</a> over 200 patients for the trial in only 15 months. This may not sound like anything special, but considering that previous trials for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme have taken as long as 3 years to enroll as many patients, it speaks volumes to the level of physician support for this new therapy.</p><p>Cancer may be smart, but based on the evidence to date, it could be that IMUC's polyvalent vaccines are even smarter. Having recently listed on the NYSE, there can be no doubt that a lot more smart money will be flowing into this company's stock. If value-oriented investors are smart, they'll beat them to it. This is a company with a valuation of under $150 million - a true hidden gem despite YTD gains larger than 100%. As many investors often say, &quot;volume precedes price.&quot; The uplisting to the NYSE gives the company exposure to a different group of retail investors as well as institutional investors. Volume cometh and could precede additional gains? Only time will tell what this company, its lead product and its common stock will do in 2012 and beyond.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[IMUC]].</p>"

Thanks to a <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-dndn-the-surge-continues"">resurgence</a> in  the Dendreon (DNDN) share price as the result of rebounding Provenge  sales, companies such as CellDex Therapeutics (CLDX), Cel-Sci Corp (CVM)  and Oncothyreon (ONTY) - in addition to Immunocellular - have all seen  their share prices rise during the opening weeks of 2012.</p> <p>As potential investors investigate the sector again, IMUC has certain  benefits that carry more potential than what even Provenge has brought  to the table.

"999861","2012-11-12 10:05:14","Companies See Green In Stevia","<p>Stevia, the herb native to Paraguay whose dried leaves are anywhere from 200 to 400 times sweeter than sugar, has become the hottest product in the zero calorie natural sugar substitute or reduced sugar market. Ever since the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the sweet stevia extract <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/stevia/AN01733"">rebaudioside A</a> (Reb A) a Generally Recognized As Safe (<a href=""http://www.steviabenefits.org/regulatorystatus.html"">GRAS</a>) status in 2008 and the European Union approved it for sale in 2011 companies large and small have clamored to bring the sweet tasting product to market. It makes sense considering the global sweetener market is a $56 billion dollar industry and the <a href=""http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/5/prweb8393658.htm"">U.S. weight loss market</a> is a $60.9 billion market. To be clear, times have changed; this is not the same taste that stevia had years ago when it sat on the health food store shelves. Today's stevia has had much of the bitter licorices and lingering aftertaste bred out, leaving a crisper sweet flavor. Giant food and beverage corporations like Coke (KO), Cargill, PepsiCo (PEP), and Merisant have worked to develop stevia based products and stevia sugar blends, like Truvia and PureVia for its diet beverage lines and tabletop use. PureCircle (PCRTF.PK) the largest producer of stevia not only teamed up with The Imperial Sugar Company to produce a stevia sugar blend called <a href=""http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/News/News%20Home/Features/2010/7/Stevia%20needs%20a%20partner%20in%20baking.aspx?cck=1"">Steviacane</a>, just last month it secured S&amp;W Seed (SANW) as its first grower in the U.S. to plant its own line of stevia plants that is supposed to have a cleaner taste with none of the bitter aftertaste. Below are three companies producing, developing or growing stevia, and though they may not get the notoriety as other companies involved in stevia these companies are worth a look.</p><p><strong>Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM)</strong> the global food processing giant out of Decatur Illinois is no stranger to the sweetener business as it is a major supplier of both high fructose corn syrup ((HFCS)) and its sugar substitute <a href=""http://www.sugar.org/other-sweeteners/sugar-alcohols.html"">sorbitol</a> a derivative of corn alcohol that is roughly 60% as sweet as sucrose. Since 2009 ADM has been working on a pilot program with farmers in Paraguay to add stevia to its pipeline of sweetening products. ADM has teamed with roughly <a href=""http://www.adm.com/en-US/responsibility/2010CR/supply_chain/Pages/sustainable_stevia.aspx"">250 farmers</a> in Paraguay to provide training for sustainable stevia cultivation practices, while helping them by providing economic support through firm marketing pricing, assisting in securing loans, and purchasing the farmers' stevia crops when harvested. Properly cultivated an acre of stevia can be harvested three to four times a year, thus the impact on the area's economy can be significant. ADM expects the project will encourage the <a href=""http://www.paraguaytimes.com/business-finance/agriculture/paraguayan-stevia-paraguays-native-sweetener.html"">production of stevia</a>, a labor-intensive crop, as a source of earnings for small farmers. ADM is hoping that the model that they set up with these initial farmers will serve as a model that can be replicated elsewhere, thus develop a new natural zero calorie sweetener for its pipeline.</p><p>ADM, with a market cap of $17.12 billion, has shown solid profits over the past 10 years, though 2011 and 2012 have been more challenging due to economic factors and the drought. ADM announced its fiscal year <a href=""http://www.adm.com/en-US/investors/Documents/ADM-IR-Overview-Presentation.pdf"">2012 net sales</a> at $89 Billion. At the end of October the company reported <a href=""http://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/ADM-Reports-MixedQuarter-Boosted-by-Oilseeds.html"">financial results</a> for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2012 with net earnings of $182 million, or $0.28 per share, down from $460 million or $0.68 per share from the first quarter of 2012. While its bioproducts decreased $179 million to a loss of $26 million sweeteners and starches profit increased $64 million to $94 million, as tight sweetener industry capacity supported higher year-over-year selling prices. The company has also implemented cost reductions by restricting its global workforce saving 150 million in its run rate, and improved processing efficiencies by reducing the costs in ethanol production, maintenance and energy costs, and closing plants that had lower returns. ADM has a strong balance sheet, and is sitting on $1.4 billion in cash which it may use for acquisitions such as Australia's largest grain handler, <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/dealjournalaustralia/2012/10/23/hurdles-to-graincorp-adm-deal/"">GrainCorp</a>, where it already owns 14.9% of its shares. The company has operating capital of $14.65 billion with a total debt of $10.3 billion. Since 2007 investors have seen ADM's dividends increase, and in October the Board of Directors declared a <a href=""http://origin.adm.com/en-US/news/_layouts/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?ID=457"">cash dividend</a> of 17.5 cents per share to Stockholders of record Nov. 15, 2012, making it the 324th consecutive quarterly payment, a record of 81 years of uninterrupted dividends. ADM stock has been battered and is down over 20% in the last six months closing at $25.47 per share. However, given the solid business practices, cost cutting, and their pipeline of products this is a good stock, and being well off its 52 week high of $33.98 makes it more attractive. At this time I think the upside potential outweighs the downside and I consider the stock a hold though if the share prices drop further it might be a good buy for ones long term portfolio.</p><p><strong>Stevia First Corp. (STVF.OB)</strong>, a small development agricultural biotechnology company in Yuba City, CA appears to be ready to move forward with its research and development as it recently secured $500,000 in funding. It also is working hard to get the word out through social media about stevia and Stevia First as a company. On Oct. 30th STVF announced that it has entered into definitive agreements with <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/STVF.OB/key-developments/article/2632950"">institutional investors</a> for the private placement of $500,000 in convertible debentures and warrants to purchase up to a total of 1,000,000 shares of common stock. The debentures are convertible into a total of 1,000,000 shares of Stevia First common stock at a $0.50 and will and bear no interest and, if not converted, will mature in two years. The warrants will have a term of five years from the issue date and will be at priced at $0.70 per share. With the proceeds STVF plans to extend its research and development operations and for general corporate purposes. One of the conditions of the closing is that the Company will receive lock-up agreements from shareholders that currently own a total 31,500,000 shares, more than 58% of the Company's outstanding common stock, will not be sold until, the earliest, February 2014. For existing investors and shareholders to be willing to lock up their investment in STVF for an extended period clearly sends a signal that they believe in the future of the company. Stevia First's <a href=""http://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/Stevia-First-Corp-Announces-Private-Placement-With-Institutional-Investors.html"">CEO Robert Brooke</a> commented on the funding, &quot;This financing supported by institutional investors is galvanizing, as it lets us continue to move our company forward on multiple fronts. Combined with existing investors' willingness to an extended lock-up period, it's a testament to the excitement and commitment that management and shareholders have to the growth and development of Stevia First.&quot;</p><p>There may be a good reason for these shareholders to have faith, and it might just lay in one of the two methods that STVF plans of on producing the sweet steviol glycosides. Unlike the other growers STVF has licensed a fermentation process that it believes will cut the cost of producing the sweet steviol glycoside up to 70% while insuring a consistent crop yield and a reliable supply line with the same flavor harvest to harvest. Simply put the fermentation process bypasses the need to grow the actual stevia plants in order to reap the steviol glycoside. The company still has in its business plan to grow a more organic farm based stevia plant on their acreage in the Central Valley of CA. This company is doing some very innovative bio farming, however, the R &amp; D does take time. In an earlier interview <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/883621-interview-with-stevia-first-ceo-robert-brooke"">CEO Robert Brooke</a> stated that if the goal of the company was to be a commodity stevia leaf grower, &quot;the company could quite easily produce stevia leaf at &quot;commercial-scale&quot; next year.&quot; Mr. Brooke went on to explain that the company will be a vertically integrated stevia enterprise, &quot;building long-term value for shareholders, and doing this by seeking to build a reliable supply chain of great-tasting stevia and stevia products for consumers and multinational companies with stringent QC requirements.&quot; Stevia First has a market cap of $22.53 million; its stock has had some volatility with a 52 week high of $3.28 in March to a low of $0.23 in mid August. However the last three months the stock has risen over 50% and trades in the mid $0.40's. As with all micro cap companies there is a higher level of associated risk, STVF is no different in that regard, so risk has to be considered before making any investments.</p><p><strong>Sunwin Stevia International (SUWN.OB)</strong> out of Qufu, China is a vertically integrated manufacturer of Stevia products and traditional Chinese medicines, and mostly has sold its products wholesale to customers in China, Japan and South Korea. However in 2006, Sunwin began to distribute stevioside into the U.S. to health food retailers, national and regional grocery chains with its table top stevia product, OnlySweet. While their stevia product is grown in China, OnlySweet is manufactured in the United States at an FDA approved blending facility. In August Sunwin entered into a worldwide stevia distribution agreement with WILD Flavors GmbH (WILD), giving WILD a non exclusive worldwide right as a distributor to market and resell all Sunwin stevia products. WILD also acquired an additional 7.67 million shares in exchange for its stake in Sunwin USA and granted Sunwin an exclusive ownership of certain flavor formulations for use with Sunwin's stevia extracts developed by WILD. Added to that <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Sunwin-International-WILD-iw-3100183469.html"">Domino Foods</a>, which produces and markets Domino, C&amp;H and Florida Crystals brands, and WILD have entered into an collaboration offering with Sunwin ,and the three companies have agreed to partner in focusing their combined efforts to introduce a wide range of all natural, low calorie and no calorie sweetening solutions that contain Sunwin Stevia.</p><p>Sunwin, a microcap stock with a market cap of $35.9 million, sells for $0.21 per share, well off its 52 week high of $0.51 per share. Its average volume has been a modest 14,910, though it has fluctuated in trading as much as 173,000 shares on Nov 1 to as low as 100 shares on Oct. 19th. Though it is in the stevia business, and has signed a collaboration agreement with both WILD and Domino, the company relies on small farms in China for their product, plus there has been little news to drive this stock one way or another. Until the company come up with positive news I think there are stronger stevia stocks that offer a greater chance for upside potential.</p><p>There is little doubt that Stevia products will continue to grow, and that more companies will be attracted to the profit potential the product can offer. I think the real potential for profit lays with stevia companies that are not just growing the product but are developing methods to improve quality, taste, consistency, while lowering the production costs. ADM is a solid company with a proven track record with a consistent dividend, and the safest bet of the companies profiled. But for a pure stevia play with the best growth potential STVF, with its development of its fermentation process and goal to be not just a grower but a producer as well, appears to be the better choice. Caution must be taken as microcap stocks can trade with higher volatility than large caps, and one should do their research on any investment that involves risk.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[ADM]], [[STVF.OB]].

Historically, biotechnology is an industry that does not respond to the volatility of the market, but rather the release of data, the speculation of an FDA approval, and then growth of sales. Strangely, on Monday and Tuesday, biotech was amongst the biggest losers in the market, including Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Celldex Therapeutics, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and Pharmacyclics. Along these high-profile companies include other less-discussed laggards such as Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ), BioMarin (BMRN), and Incyte (INCY). Overall, it has been very ugly for biotechs. However, with huge data announcements scheduled in the next three months, there are still some investments in biotechnology that could be lucrative, regardless of the market.</p><p><b>NewLink Genetics</b> <b>(NLNK)</b></p><p>In 2013, shares of NewLink Genetics have rallied almost 50% -- this despite a 10% collapse on Tuesday. For the last year, investors have awaited data to support the impressive findings in years prior, regarding both pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Back in late September, NewLink gave investors a taste of what may come: The <a href=""http://www.4-traders.com/NEWLINK-GENETICS-CORP-9420564/news/NewLink-Genetics-Corp--NewLink-Genetics-Presents-Data-Demonstrating-Potential-Chemo-sensitization-A-17308773/"">company announced</a> that its HyperAcute immunotherapy platform produced a better-than-expected response in the treatment of both diseases.</p><p>In treating pancreatic cancer, three patients experienced a complete response. In the most difficult to treat of NSCLC patients, 25% of 16 patients achieved stable disease and 31% achieved a partial response. Overall, this data was strong, but clearly incomplete and based on a small patient population. With that said, investors are anxiously awaiting future interim analyses from larger patient populations in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. So far, data has been robust and, if continued, NewLink could become a Wall Street favorite with an entire platform of HyperAcute products to treat cancer. A large interim look at data is <a href=""http://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/fda-calendar/"">expected</a> in the first quarter of 2014, which will no doubt significantly move NewLink's stock.</p><p><b>Pharmacyclics</b> <b>(PCYC)</b></p><p>When investors talk about Pharmacyclics, the first and only thought is ibrutinib. It is this drug that has produced a five-year 6,000% plus return. And while ibrutinib is all but a certain FDA approval and blockbuster product, I am more interested to know whether or not Pharmacyclics is a one-trick pony, or if research and innovation is the new standard at Pharmacyclics.</p><p>Pharmacyclics is a 20-year-old company that had produced nothing up until ibrutinib. Therefore, some have questioned whether or not the company simply stumbled across greatness, or if it was due to a change in culture. With that said, I am anxious about Phase 2 interim data on PCI-27483 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, which is <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/949699/000144530513000345/a201210-k.htm"">due later this year</a>.</p><p>This is a product that is <a href=""http://www.4-traders.com/PHARMACYCLICS-INC-10417/news/Pharmacyclics-Inks-Agreement-With-Novo-Nordisk-for-Molecule-Inhibitor-15319575/"">partnered</a> with Novo Nordisk, but also has low expectations, and has been very slow to progress in clinical trials. In fact, for all the analysts who cover Pharmacyclics, I have yet to ever hear peak sales projections or a valuation model based on any of Pharmacyclics' pipeline, including PCI-27483. As of now, there is no prior data strong enough to draw conclusions about the interim results. Therefore, investors have to simply wait, making it interesting to see whether or not Pharmacyclics is developing a pipeline full of promise, or if it's just a product of promise.</p><p><b>OncoSec</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>(ONCS.OB)</b></p><p>OncoSec is a tiny company, but one with so many end-of-year catalysts that I can't help but to acknowledge it. First, the company develops an electroporation platform (use of electricity to create temporary pores and increase uptake while decreasing side effects) using immunotherapy products. Currently, OncoSec is developing its platform with IL-12 as a product called ImmunoPulse, which is being tested on metastatic melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), and cutaneous T cell lymphoma.</p><p>The melanoma study is OncoSec's most advanced trial, and last month the company <a href=""http://marketplayground.com/2013/09/12/oncosec-medical-inc-otcmktsoncs-a-presentation-of-catalysts/"">updated its Phase 2</a> trial with data from 13 patients. In that update, 73% of targeted lesions demonstrated at least a 30% decline in size by day 90; 49% of targeted lesions had a complete response by day 90; and 85% of patients had a partial response. All data far exceeds that of Yervoy, and is consistent with all data that we've seen to date, but is still small.</p><p>With this data in mind, I am very excited to see additional data later this year. On the company's website there is a list of <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/about-us/oncosec-milestones/#38"">future milestones</a>, too many to name, but these include long-term progression-free survival data on the melanoma study, interim data for MCC, and then the launch of a Phase 2b MCC and melanoma study early next year. These could create large gains if data goes in OncoSec's favor.</p><p>Then, there is data from research that the company has been compiling over the last year(s). On Tuesday OncoSec announced positive preliminary data on animal studies using ImmunoPulse with anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 antibodies. According to the <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/oncosec-medical-announces-positive-preliminary-100500408.html"">press release</a>, 100% of the 40 mice saw regression in treated lesions with none dying from toxicity. This is big news, and shows the potential for ImmunoPulse to expand with new therapeutics, which just adds to the list of catalysts in the next few months.</p><p>Now, with all things considered, this is a tiny company with a market cap of just <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=oncs&amp;ql=1"">$45 million</a>. It is somewhat under-the-radar, but at the same time is endorsed by several contributors. I first learned of OncoSec from a <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1049441-oncosec-medical-2013-will-be-a-year-of-crucial-events"">previous SA article</a>; then did my own research; and I found that OncoSec does in fact have good data to date, especially considering its market capitalization. However, investors should note risks such as the possibility of failed clinical studies and volatility. As of now, financing does not seem to be an issue; the company just raised money and only burns $580,000 per month. Therefore, invest wisely and be sure to perform proper due diligence.</p><p><b>Celldex Therapeutics</b> <b>(CLDX)</b></p><p>Celldex Therapeutics has been one of the best performing biotechs over the last year, seeing gains over 350%. However, its five-day 22.5% loss might present a good opportunity with the company having data for both its glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) drug, <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/744218/000110465913060226/a13-13533_110q.htm"">CDX-110</a>, and its dense deposit disease drug, <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/744218/000110465913060226/a13-13533_110q.htm"">CDX-1135</a> , in the near future.</p><p>In the last year, it was data from the company's breast cancer drug, CDX-011, that produced such large gains, after it <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/5022721-final-data-from-celldex-therapeutics-cdx-011-phase-2-study-in-metastatic-breast-cancer-supports-overall-survival-benefit-in-patients-with-high-gpnmb-expression"">delayed growth and extended life</a> in the most difficult to treat patients, those with no options. Thus, investors now assume that Celldex's entire platform must work, and that particular theory will be put to the test with future data announcements.</p><p>With CDX-110, there is reason to believe that data will be positive. The company has already <a href=""http://ir.celldextherapeutics.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=784514"">expanded</a> the study by an additional 75 patients due to early evidence of anti-tumor activity. But still, investors want to know more thorough data from the first 25 patients enrolled, which is expected to be announced in November.</p><p>With CDX-1135, Celldex is treating an orphan disease and, if successful, makes Celldex one of the most diversified small biotechs in the market. This particular study will be closely monitored because there is a strong belief that CDX-1135 could expand into additional indications and possibly compete with Alexion's Soliris. Both drugs are complement modulators, but CDX-1135 binds to both the C3 and C5 component whereas Soliris only binds to C5. With Soliris generating over $1 billion in annual sales and supporting a $20 billion market capitalization for Alexion, data from this small pilot study could go a long way in the mind of investors.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>The market may tumble in the fourth quarter of this year, but with important data announcements, these four companies might prove resilient. OncoSec clearly has the lowest expectations with the most to gain, yet has nothing except strong data to support ImmunoPulse. NewLink and Celldex have the most to lose with bad data, and with Pharmacyclics, very few are even looking at its pipeline. However, strong data could help in solidifying diversification for each of these companies. Either way, these companies should be watched in the final two months of 2013.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[ONCS.OB]], [[CLDX]].

You'd get brand new materials compatible with the old stuff. Take that principle and apply it to regenerative medicine, and you have a rough idea of what a biotech company called NeoStem (NBS) is up to.</p><p>The company calls it cell therapy, but think of it as tissue repair, replacing bad cells with good cells. Imagine Uncle Bob having better vision because his macular degeneration was reversed, or Aunt Millie having a few more years because she bounced back from her radiation treatments enough to beat cancer.</p><p>The idea is simple. <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/clinical-development/amorcyte.html"">Supply a patient</a> with massive amounts of friendly, unrejectable, and replenishable cells, which originated in their own body. These &quot;autologous&quot; cells are created then furnished to patients as needed. NeoStem is poised to fully implement this model.</p><p>At a glance NeoStem might look like a biotech preoccupied with research. But a closer look reveals big plans. NeoStem has been quietly completing a series of acquisitions that will give the company some very impressive products, plus the pipeline to deliver them.</p><p>Take Progenitor Cell Therapy (PCT), a manufacturer with lab facilities in New Jersey and California. Now a wholly owned NeoStem subsidiary, PCT has had significant revenue growth over the last several quarters with an A-list clientele that has chosen them for their contract manufacturing needs. PCT had revenues of <a href=""http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=9149939-1169-598565%26type=sect%26dcn=0000320017-13-000009"">$8 million</a> for the year ended Dec 31st 2012, representing an increase of 46% YOY. NeoStem has already announced new client agreements earlier this year, so further growth of this division is expected going forward.</p><p>Want more proof of big plans? Try the <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/neostem-awarded-second-niaid-research-120902461.html"">two-year research grant</a> from the National Institutes Of Health's NIAID division (National Institute Of Allergy And Infectious Diseases) just delivered. This grant recognizes the potential value of regenerative cell therapy, and specifically, the promise of NeoStem's VSELs (&quot;very small embryonic-like&quot; stem cells) as a countermeasure to radiological damage. Simply put, cancer survivability may soon increase dramatically once recovery from radiation therapy is made easier. There's even a potential application for gum disease. According to Dr. Robin L. Smith, Chairman and CEO of NeoStem, the company plans to file an IND (investigational new drug) with the FDA in late 2013 or early 2014 in hopes of initiating a NIH-funded human clinical study treating periodontitis with VSELs.</p><p>&quot;VSELs might be an ideal cell therapy,&quot; says Dr. Denis Rodgerson, Director Of Stem Cell Science at NeoStem, &quot;to regenerate the body's immune system and repair other tissues damaged by radiation exposure. Early studies show VSELs are resistant to lethal radiation, which destroys other immune system-restoring stem cells in the body.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Those exposed to acute high-dose radiation,&quot; Rodgerson continues, &quot;have compromised immune systems such that the virulence and infectivity of biological agents is dramatically increased. Death can occur within one to six weeks following radiation exposure. Currently there is only one intervention that saves a fatally irradiated person - a rescue through stem cell transplantation.&quot; NeoStem has received multiple research and funding grants of over $4 million dollars to continue development of this technology. These grants assist in keeping the company's cash reserves high and allows for continued progress.</p><p>The company's Amorcyte subsidiary is in the midst of a phase 2 trial of a promising heart-healer called AMR-001, which also utilizes autologous cells, but actually injects them directly into the heart in the critical days after a heart attack when tissue is still raw. The costs associated with heart disease are staggering, according to the <a href=""http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthcareResearch/LearningLibraryandResearch/Learning-Library-and-Research_UCM_305462_SubHomePage.jsp"">American Heart Association</a> the current medical cost associated with cardiovascular disease is $273 billion and that number is expected to triple over the next 20 years.</p><p>NeoStem's been shaping up its balance sheet, too. Last year the company sold its half interest in China's Suzhou Erye pharmaceutical division. The company board of directors recently got a star in <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/news/stephen-potter.html"">Stephen Potter</a>, formerly of Osiris Therapeutics, the first company to have an approved cell therapy product. His presence speaks volumes about NeoStem's chances of success.</p><p>&quot;A decade ago everything was about the future promise of what cells could do,&quot; <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1285521-cell-therapy-leader-stephen-potter-talks-osiris-neostem-and-the-industry-itself"">Potter states</a>. &quot;Now there are thousands of clinical investigations and trials.&quot;</p><p>The month of April 2013 has been quite eventful, perhaps will be the &quot;watershed&quot; for the upcoming year. NeoStem has made the rounds of some high-profile industry events such as the Cancer Immunology Conference in Washington and the Tenth Stem Cell Summit in Boston.</p><p>And then there's the Vatican. The Roman Catholic Church has embraced autologous stem cell production, as an ethical alternative to the morally challenged embryonic variety. They've reconsidered antiquated views, and now they're partnering with NeoStem.</p><p>Monsignor Tomasz Trafny, who heads up a newly formed Vatican body called the Science and Faith Foundation, just hosted the Second International Vatican Adult Stem Cell Conference in Rome with 2012 Nobel Prize Winner Dr. John Gurdon as keynote speaker. A CNN headline summed up the effort, &quot;Vatican Seeks To Rebrand Its Relationship With Science.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This unusual marriage of church and biotech,&quot; <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/11/world/pope-vatican-science"">wrote CNN s Florence Davey-Attlee</a>, &quot;is a targeted public affairs initiative. The Vatican aims to use the partnership to show people there is an alternative to embryonic stem cell research - which it vehemently opposes - that doesn't involve the destruction of human embryos.&quot;</p><p>The Vatican has invested a million dollars in this collaborative effort, which is a huge endorsement that could blow away clouds of doubt in cultures unsure about cell therapy. This could be a worldwide stamp of approval that could put NeoStem's lab savvy into hospitals and clinics all over the globe. <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1331561-the-vatican-neostem-partnership-looks-to-create-interest-and-advance-cell-therapy"">Monsignor Trafny keeps the focus</a> on ethics and the advancement of science for the benefit of mankind, not dollars.</p><p>&quot;We had a very tough time trying to find who would be our partner and meet our requirements,&quot; said the Monsignor. &quot;We were looking for companies and institutions who had never been involved in embryonic stem cells and who have very clear statements on their work.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Secondly,&quot; Trafny continues, &quot;we looked for someone who would share knowledge with us and give us access to their labs and be trained by their experts. The third part, which is important, is that we looked for <span>someone <br></span>who was interested in the cultural issues. NeoStem met all of our needs.&quot;</p><p>By &quot;cultural issues&quot; Trafny, of course, means the dynamic between Church and public, and the Vatican's ability to shift credibly to a pro-science stance.</p><p>&quot;We want people to know,&quot; Trafny clarified, &quot;that the Church is supporting research AND science and that they (Catholics) don't need to make a choice.&quot;</p><p>If NeoStem's business model succeeds, countless lives could be saved and improved. Within several years physicians could be e-mailing PCT for a new batch of John or Jane Doe's cells, then having them infused in that same doctor's office the very next day.</p><p>NeoStem is set up nicely for success, however the company is still in the development stages of its treatments that offer the largest potential returns to investors. Certain risk factors are present and will remain an issue in the near term. Clinical trials take time and a large capital investment, and although data has been positive thus far, it does not mean that the FDA will grant final approval.

"1686962","2013-09-11 10:15:29","Inovio's Partnership And Its Many Benefits","<p>No matter how you spin it - whether long or short - <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/roche-inovio-pharmaceuticals-partner-inovios-080000293.html"">Roche's $400 million plus partnership</a> with <b>Inovio Pharmaceuticals</b> <b>(INO)</b> is good for both Inovio and investors. Currently, shares are trading higher by 15%, making its one-week performance 50%-- although this deal might have major implications beyond what is seen with the naked eye.</p><p>At the surface, we see $10 million upfront for two preclinical vaccines-- prostate and hepatitis B products-- milestones up to $412.5 million and a double-digit royalty on future sales. As we dig deeper these positive factors limit the threat of dilution, support the possibility for additional partnerships or a takeover, and they present as major news for both immunotherapy and electroporation as industries.</p><p><b>What's The Deal?</b></p><p>A partnership with Roche might be Inovio's biggest news in the company's history, indicating that Inovio is on track to gainful bounties. In many ways, this partnership was not expected. For the last several months investors had been <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1582892-inovio-may-prove-to-be-mercks-solution"">speculating</a> about a potential Merck partnership or buyout -- adding to a 2004 licensing agreement with Merck -- which then led to Inovio's mid-year rally.</p><p>Instead, the vaccine powerhouse Roche saw upside in Inovio's &quot;preclinical&quot; vaccines: INO-5150 for prostate cancer and INO-1800 for hepatitis B. I emphasize the word <i>preclinical</i> because these are two programs in the earliest stages of development, with only animal testing. Roche did not license any of Inovio's more advanced programs such as its cervical dysplasia, HIV, or influenza segments, all of which use synthetic vaccines and electroporation for delivery.</p><p>Hopefully, Inovio and Roche will have a long and lucrative relationship. Investors should note that the $11 million received will add to the company's $23.5 million in cash, but larger cash payouts are unlikely to be awarded in the earlier stages of development. With that said, $412.5 million in potential payouts is more than enough to properly develop these two candidates and also limit the amount of dilution in shares of this company.</p><p>Overall, I think this is quite the boon for Inovio-- and the possibility does quiet a lot of naysayers. But let's look at two other beneficiaries to this deal.</p><p><b>Electroporation Is Validated</b></p><p>Inovio has been developing electroporation-based vaccines for many years-- and many considered it to be a dead technology. With this partnership, Roche will gain access to Inovio's electroporation technology, which is used to administer Inovio's vaccines.</p><p>Electroporation is used to bypass the body's natural way of fighting foreign substances. The process uses electrical pulses to create temporary pores in cancer cells. These temporary pores then allow for permeability-a way for a therapy such as a vaccine to access the cancer-while also preventing collateral damage and spillage to other body systems. In theory, this approach allows for less of an agent to be used whilst improving uptake--with fewer side effects. So far, we have seen this at work successfully.</p><p>Firstly, both of Inovio's partnered preclinical vaccines successfully induced the immune system's T cells in animal studies. The company's HIV study also saw <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/7020722-inovio-s-cellectra-r-electroporation-delivery-technology-powers-durable-best-in-class-t-cell-responses-from-hiv-vaccine-in-human-study"">increased</a> CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. In addition, electroporation technology stimulated blood vessel growth in another Inovio <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/synthetically-optimized-hif-1-alpha-080000256.html"">study</a>. Hence, electroporation is proven viable and is clearly one of the reasons that Roche found Inovio attractive.</p><p>Another electroporation company is <b>OncoSec Medical</b> <b>(ONCS.OB)</b>, using the same technology, though the company does not use synthetic vaccines. Instead, OncoSec uses IL-12, as an immunotherapy, and bleomycin as a chemotherapy. With bleomycin, just 1/20 of the traditional dose is required to achieve effective results, thus proving the capabilities of electroporation to increase uptake.</p><p>Much like Inovio, OncoSec has produced great clinical results with its electroporation approach. In its metastatic melanoma <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/importance-of-durable-response-rate-for-cancer-treatment-trials/"">study</a>, 45% of treated lesions showed a durable response at three months, nearly twice as effective as Amgen's TVEC. In treating Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), all patients saw <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-initiates-phase-ii-clinical-program-in-cutaneous-t-cell-lymphoma-and-doses-first-patient"">elevated levels</a> of IL-12 and 33% saw elevated levels of CD8+ T cells in targeted tumors.</p><p>In 2013, both electroporation plays have appreciated nicely. With electroporation producing good data, and Roche's acquisition adding a little spark to the optimism, investors must feel confident heading into a data packed year. Most notably, Inovio will present data for several of its early stage studies, and OncoSec will be <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-medical-announces-2013-milestones-and-corporate-strategy"">presenting Phase 2 data</a> on both metastatic melanoma and MCC, an orphan indication, meaning the future could be even better for electroporation stocks.</p><p><b>Immunotherapy Trades Lower, But Shouldn't</b></p><p>Inovio is the first company to have a <a href=""http://www.inovio.com/technology/synthetic-vaccines/"">synthetic vaccine</a> create an immune response, and because its goal is to stimulate the immune system, Inovio is in many ways an immunotherapy company. In fact, <a href=""http://www.inovio.com/technology/synthetic-vaccines/"">Inovio says</a> that it develops multi-antigen DNA immunotherapies. Naturally, Inovio is in fact an immunotherapy company.</p><p>While a major partnership with one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world should seem like a bonus for immunotherapy, most developmental companies in the space are trading lower following Inovio's news. As of this moment, <b>Dendreon</b> <b>(DNDN)</b> and <b>NewLink Genetics</b> <b>(NLNK)</b> are marginally lower, while <b>Vical (VICL)</b>, <b>Oncothyreon (ONTY)</b>, and <b>ImmunoCellular Therapeutics (IMUC)</b> have losses greater than 1%, and <b>Galena Biopharma</b> <b>(GALE)</b> is trading lower by more than 5%</p><p>Among those mentioned, Dendreon's inability to turn a profit and its recent decline in revenue have created some rumors that a large pharma might try to acquire and integrate the company's drug, Provenge, into their business. The partnership with Inovio doesn't hurt these chances; in fact it might show that companies like Roche are looking at immunotherapy companies.</p><p>NewLink Genetics has a platform called &quot;HyperAcute&quot; that is being tested to treat countless cancers. With Inovio's electroporation approach, also a system of sorts, I am a bit surprised that NewLink isn't trading higher following the partnership news.</p><p>Galena, the biggest loser in the space, even has a <a href=""http://www.earningsimpact.com/Transcript/83505/GALE/Galena-Biopharma-Inc---15th-Annual-Rodman-and-Renshaw-Global-Investment-Conference"">collaboration</a> with Roche where it is testing Herceptin with its vaccine, NeuVax. Galena's NeuVax is believed to treat the remaining 50% of breast cancer patients who do not qualify for Herceptin and, in a Phase 2 trial, saw breast cancer recurrence decline nearly 80% compared to the control. Thus, with the connections, and Galena's notable partnership with Teva, I am surprised to see this stock trading lower.</p><p>Nonetheless, despite the initial industry reaction, Inovio's partnership with Roche is a bonus for immunotherapy. It simply shows that big eyes are on this emerging space.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>Unfortunately, after Inovio's 15% gains on Tuesday, we probably won't hear too much more about this partnership in the future, with the exception of the occasional analyst outlook or investor blog. This is news that we as investors won't see materialize for many years, as it could be 5 years before significant data is known or 10 years before we know if Roche made a good investment into Inovio's preclinical products.</p><p>With that said, I think investors should view Roche's partnership not as a verification of future success, but rather a level of interest, or an investment into Inovio's therapeutic approach. It shows that either Inovio is very good at selling itself to big pharma, or that big pharma believes Inovio's multi-antigen DNA immunotherapy electroporation approach is at least a piece of future medicine. If so, implications are quite bullish for a large industry, making this a rather important partnership.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

"493471","2012-04-12 06:49:04","Long Galena Biopharma: Creating A New Breast Cancer Treatment Alternative","<p>It's a sentence no woman wants to hear: &quot;I'm sorry, but you have breast cancer.&quot; The diagnosis is a devastating one, yet one that thousands of women receive every year. For all the &quot;awareness&quot; and attention the disease garners in the media, the knowledge that you or someone you love has breast cancer comes as a major shock.</p><p>Sadly, while deaths from heart attack, stroke and infectious disease have plunged due to new treatments and better preventative measures, deaths from cancer have not. Lewis A. Chodosh of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania states, &quot;We have now reached a tipping point in history at which deaths from cancer will soon surpass those from cardiovascular disease. In this regard, breast cancer holds the dubious honor of having become the leading cause of cancer mortality among women worldwide.&quot;</p><p>Adding to this troubling fact is the reality that in many cases, women are not adequately informed of their surgical treatment options. A <a href=""http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=153807"">revealing study</a> from the University of North Carolina questioned breast cancer survivors about their understanding of their disease and how much information their doctors had provided them with. Researchers found that less than half of the respondents knew that a lumpectomy, a procedure which removes the tumor rather than the breast itself, leads to higher rates of recurrence than does a mastectomy. Only 56% knew that survival rates were nearly equal with both options. Even more disturbing, however, was the fact that less than half of the women said their surgeons had even asked them which option they preferred, indicating that perhaps doctors make assumptions about a patient's wishes that may not necessarily be the case.</p><p>The study's lead author, Dr. Clara Lee, an associate professor of surgery and director of surgical research at UNC's School of Medicine in Chapel Hill, believes that women who do choose mastectomy were less likely to be given the treatment they prefer. &quot;Patients reported that their doctors were more likely to discuss breast conservation therapy and its advantages than mastectomy,&quot; said Lee. &quot;And many women did not recall being asked for their preference. We know from other studies that doctors don't always know their patients' personal preferences, so they may not be fully aware when a woman truly prefers mastectomy,&quot;</p><p>Why is there a breakdown in communication over such a life-altering decision? Possible explanations are that the surgeon didn't properly explain the options, or perhaps didn't explain them in a way the patient could understand. Or perhaps the woman's distress during such an emotional time prevented her from even absorbing the information presented to her. Regardless, it is crucial that doctors strive to communicate with their patients and ensure that they truly understand all options.</p><p>Yet even with such gaps in communication between doctor and patient, there is much to celebrate as we look ahead at new treatments currently on the horizon. In the past several years, researchers and physicians have made great strides in the fight against this insidious disease. Compared to the limited choices of even a few years ago, today's woman faced with the agonizing decision of how best to treat and manage her cancer has numerous options. A quick Internet search or discussion with cancer survivors will surely turn up stories of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, perhaps complementary or holistic treatments. But as we head deeper into the 21st century, a promising new cancer treatment is beginning to make headlines.</p><p>This exciting development is the advent of immunotherapy, which specifically targets and attacks cancer cells. Rather than rely on outside factors such as radiation or the surgeon's scalpel to remove tumors or shrink tumor cells, immunotherapy, or a cancer &quot;vaccine&quot;, uses the patient's own immune system to fight the invading cancer cells. According to the National Cancer Institute, &quot;Cancer treatment vaccines are designed to treat cancers that have already developed. They are intended to delay or stop cancer cell growth; to cause tumor shrinkage; to prevent cancer from coming back; or to eliminate cancer cells that have not been killed by other forms of treatment.&quot;</p><p>The benefit of such a therapy is obvious: while chemotherapy and radiation are effective in killing cancer cells, they also kill the surrounding healthy cells and tissue, resulting in sometimes devastating side effects for the patient. Therefore, a treatment option that would specifically target only the metastasized tumor cells while not harming healthy tissue has long been the Holy Grail of cancer treatment.</p><p>While the idea of a therapeutic cancer &quot;vaccine&quot; has been posited in theory for over a century, not until recently has this vision started to become reality. In April 2010 the FDA approved the first cancer treatment vaccine, Dendreon's (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/dndn"">DNDN</a>) Provenge, for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, followed by Bristol-Myers' (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/bmy"">BMY</a>) Yervoy for melanoma the following year, creating a buzz in the both the medical and scientific communities as well as fueling great interest in the arena of commercial investment in the development of additional vaccines.</p><p>So it is with great anticipation that scientists and investors monitor the latest research, clinical trials and published results coming from several prominent biopharmaceutical companies. Every week, every month brings new and exciting developments, sparking the imaginations of medical practitioners and the hopes of cancer sufferers worldwide. One such company that seems poised for success is <strong>Galena Biopharma (</strong><a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/gale""><strong>GALE</strong></a><strong>)</strong>, whose self-proclaimed mission is focused on &quot;discovering, developing and commercializing innovative therapies addressing major unmet medical needs using targeted biotherapeutics&quot;. Galena, formerly of RXi Pharmaceuticals, changed its overall business strategy as it began to focus on cancer vaccines. One such vaccine currently in the pipeline is NeuVax, an experimental treatment targeting a common type of breast cancer.</p><p>According to data from the National Cancer Institute, over 200,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, 25 percent of which test positive for the HER2 receptor. Unfortunately, once the cancer is in remission, only 25 percent are eligible for Roche-Genentech's (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/rhhby.pk"">RHHBY.PK</a>) breakthrough drug Herceptin, the current gold standard of treatment following a patient becoming cancer-free. For the majority of women who don't qualify, however, the news that there are currently no further options to prevent a recurrence comes as a painful blow. Clearly there is a great need for an alternative form of treatment for many thousands of women.</p><p>Enter NeuVax, which targets HER2-positive patients (HER2 1+ and 2+) who achieve remission with current standard of care, but have no available HER2-targeted adjuvant treatment options to prevent the cancer from returning. The hope is that NeuVax could delay disease recurrence and progression in breast cancer patients whose tumors express only low to intermediate levels of the HER2 receptor, and who thus are ineligible to receive Herceptin, which blocks that receptor. If NeuVax can successfully spur the body's own killer T-cells to attack cells expressing any level of HER2, it will certainly fill a great need for these women. Aside from the many women who could benefit from this type of drug, it could potentially mean enormous profits for Galena and its investors as well as a boon to the pharmaceutical industry as a whole.</p><p>Considering the fact that if Herceptin, which is limited in its ability to treat just 25% of breast cancer survivors, is currently doing nearly $6 billion in annual sales, imagine the potential of NeuVax, which would be able to target the other 75%. The upside potential for both the company and its investors is enormous, possibly offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. This could propel Galena into further research and make even greater strides towards healing people and bettering their quality of life.</p><p>Thus far Galena has had great success in Phase I/II trials, reporting data indicating that NeuVax could indeed potentially aid patients in remaining disease-free. In late January, the company announced their Phase III trial named PRESENT (Prevention of Recurrence in Early-Stage, Node-Positive Breast Cancer with Low to Intermediate HER2 Expression with NeuVax Treatment), well ahead of its original planned date of April 2012. The trial design has been updated to include current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines and recently received Special Protocol Assessment ((SPA)) concurrence from the FDA. If the results of the final trial are as promising as they were in the previous trials, the data will be presented to the FDA for approval&hellip;and the breast cancer sufferers everywhere will have a powerful new weapon in their arsenal.</p><p>With around 100 trial sites and over 700 patients throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe, the eyes of the scientific and medical community are anxiously awaiting the outcome of the clinical trials. The implications for breast cancer sufferers are enormous; so too are the ramifications for cancer patients in a larger sense. With each successful breakthrough vaccine, researchers inch closer and closer to achieving the ultimate goal of a vaccine targeting every form of cancer.</p><p>Once nothing more the product of wishful thinking, cancer immunotherapy, though still in its infancy, is emerging as one of the most exciting and promising medical breakthroughs of the century. Galena is a play on the hope for greater success in this area.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/gale"">GALE</a>, <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/rhhby.pk"">RHHBY.PK</a>.</p>"
"967931","2012-11-01 08:19:59","Recent Biotech Price Dips Make Great Entries For Investors","<p>The biotechnology sector is among the most volatile in the market. It includes companies of great opportunity, trends that can reverse quickly, and stocks that will trade higher regardless of the overall market sentiment. The volatility of the industry often provides good entry points for investors to take advantage of promising stocks. As a result, I am taking a look at several companies with key developments that have traded lower in the last few sessions. I'm not suggesting that any of these stocks are a buy, but are worthy of your due diligence.</p><p><b>BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN)</b></p><p>After trending over $43 per share, BioMarin Pharmaceuticals has pulled back by more than 14% during the last seven sessions. The company has been one of the most consistent performers since 2009, and in the past, all periods of profit taking have proven to be great opportunities.</p><p>BioMarin announced earnings last Thursday after the market closed, and the company reported a narrower loss than expected along with <a href=""http://community.nasdaq.com/News/2012-10/biomarin-reports-narrower-loss-analyst-blog.aspx?storyid=185024"">reaffirming</a> full-year revenue guidance for the year. Some had suggested that its fall, prior to earnings, was due to whispers that the company would miss expectations. During the company's last quarter, it posted sales growth of 12%, its loss had widened, and with it not expected to achieve profitability in the next year, some are pessimistic. Therefore, its loss was most likely attributed to the fear of earnings and the potential response.</p><p>The company does have a promising and diversified pipeline to complement a large product line. Therefore, it could become a great investment following its loss. In my opinion, its loss has been in anticipation of earnings, but now that the company has reported we may see new buying pressure. My only concern is the time frame for achieving profitability, the company has done a good job at keeping investors up to date, however in this economy I want to see results. Either way, with its current loss, it's worth your due diligence.</p><p><b>OncoSec Medical (ONCS.OB)</b></p><p>A couple weeks ago I received an email regarding a company called OncoSec Medical. At the time I had never heard of the company, but for some reason I have kept it on my radar during the last month. I find this to be a very interesting company because of both its technology and the investors who follow it. The stock had traded flatly all year. But last month the company announced data presentations, and the stock doubled in preparation of the announcements.</p><p>Last Tuesday the company <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/marketupdate/inplay#oncs"">announced</a> its first round of data for Merkel Cell carcinoma ((MCC)), and results were very encouraging. The company proved that OncoSec Medical System increased levels of IL-12 in the tumor environment without any safety issues, and one patient saw a significant reduction in cancer throughout his body. However, the disease is rare, the study was small, and the results were expected. Therefore, the stock actually fell 15% on the day of the announcement, and has since continued to fall, but not because results were bad, but rather priced into the stock.</p><p>In terms of importance, the MCC data was not anticipated to the same degree as the metastatic melanoma data. Metastatic melanoma is a much more common disease and presents significantly greater sales potential. Yet, judging by what I've learned about the company, I believe the MCC trial was to see the platform's effectiveness at treating the disease as a determinant to whether or not the company moved forward in MCC trials. I think that with encouraging results the company can move forward, and will move forward, into later trials, and eventually earn an FDA approval for the technology.</p><p>The company is scheduled to announce data for the more important metastatic melanoma trial in November, and the stock could very well trade much higher in anticipation of that data. As I said, the metastatic melanoma data is much more significant, in some ways it's the dinner after the appetizer (MCC data) in regards to the future of this company. My personal belief is that investors sold the stock without really knowing why, to lock in near term profits or avoid loss. And despite it still trading with gains of 50% over the last month, I expect ONCS to trade sharply higher in the next two weeks in preparation of this much more significant data, which I might add uses the exact same technology. The stock's trend caught my eye and I believe is worth your due diligence, because once it posts one day of gains, watch out, it could create a domino effect!</p><p><b>Idenix Pharmaceuticals (IDIX)</b></p><p>Idenix Pharmaceuticals is a company that has gone from one extreme to the other. In July it was trading over $11, with a $1.4 billion market cap, as it <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/IDIX.O/key-developments/article/2578694"">announced</a> that it received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for its chronic hepatitis C product, IDX719. But just a few days later the company announced a $150 million offering of common stock and its shares fell to $8. If that wasn't enough, then the company <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/3861251-idenix-provides-update-on-idx184-clinical-development-program"">announced</a> that the FDA placed its IDX184 treatment for hepatitis C on a partial clinical hold following &quot;serious cardiac-related adverse events.&quot; Subsequently, the stock sunk even lower to $6.</p><p>Now priced at $3.70, the company has lost much of the support from investors and has continued to trade lower. In the six sessions alone the stock has lost more than 13% of its value, trading at 52-week lows. The fall of this stock has been incredible seeing as how it was one of the best performing stocks in the market throughout 2011.</p><p>Idenix still has one hepatitis C treatment, while the other remains on hold. Some consider Achillion Pharmaceuticals (ACHN) to be its primary competitor, and the much better choice, as it continues to rally on strong data. However, the overall potential for hepatitis C drugs is great, meaning if Idenix's drug progresses through trials with success it would present significant upside for the stock. Although, the main question is if Idenix is now worth buying, and personally, I am not so sure.</p><p>I, like many investors, found its $150 million offering to be very disheartening considering it was just days before the &quot;clinical hold&quot; of one of its most promising products. Perhaps I should look past this issue and see that the stock could indeed be undervalued. However, in this economy, actions such as the ones on behalf of management are often unforgettable, especially when it costs investors such a large amount of money. With that being said, the FDA does seem to support IDX719, and the market potential for the product is large. The stock is cheap and any positive news could lead to large gains. Therefore, IDIX is worth your due diligence but should be thoroughly assessed.</p><p><b>Orexigen Therapeutics (OREX)</b></p><p>Orexigen Therapeutics is the third part to the weight loss company equation. Most are aware of the company's story: Its lead candidate, Contrave, was denied in early 2011 due to potential heart risks, therefore the company has taken part in a large &quot;Light Study&quot; to assess any cardiovascular events.</p><p>On Monday the company <a href=""http://www.sacbee.com/2012/10/22/4928711/orexigen-therapeutics-receives.html"">announced</a> that it had received a dispute response indicating that the FDA is &quot;highly supportive&quot; to explore a faster path to the resubmission of Contrave. The company also announced that it had surpassed enrollment of 7,000 patients, therefore speeding up the time to interim analysis. On this news you might guess that it traded higher, however the stock quickly reversed and has since traded lower by 8%.</p><p>After the news was announced, Orexigen temporarily popped but then sold off throughout the day, and then further into Tuesday due to heavy selling pressure in the overall market. This is a stock that has traded higher by 250% in 2012, thanks to the approval of both Arena Pharmaceuticals (ARNA) and VIVUS' (VVUS) weight loss products. Most Orexigen investors now believe in the likelihood of Contrave being awarded an approval, with the FDA seeming more accepting of the need for weight loss drugs.</p><p>The company's stock has remained volatile over the last few weeks, and trades with the performance of both Arena and VIVUS. Therefore, despite the good news from Orexigen, VIVUS dragged its shares lower with its <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-19/vivus-obesity-drug-fails-to-win-european-agency-backing"">failure</a> to win European Agency backing, in addition to lower sales <a href=""http://themarketsareopen.blogspot.com/2012/10/vvus-vivus-inc-nasdaqvvus-analyst-predicts.html"">estimates</a> from analysts who cover the stock. As a result of its weakness, I think OREX is a stock worth watching.</p><p>Orexigen could be close to an FDA approval, is valued under $400 million, and is more than $2 from its 2012 highs. And with Arena preparing to launch a drug that could very well exceed all expectations, due to its marketing and safety benefits, OREX may be preparing to rally. In fact, I'd also watch Arena Pharmaceuticals, as with its launch we might see increased buying pressure and a stock that breaks its current range. I believe both stocks are worthy of your due diligence.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[ARNA]]. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

"1243661","2013-03-04 10:04:44","A Comprehensive Look At Immunotherapy - Part 2","<p>I previously published <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1167861-a-comprehensive-look-at-immunotherapy-with-analyst-immunologist-dr-rahul-jasuja"">Part 1 of a two-piece interview</a> with Dr. Rahul Jasuja, an analyst with Noble Financial. Dr. Jasuja's insight is unique because of his educational background - he is trained in immunology. In a sense, he's not a &quot;Wall Street guy&quot;, but rather a medical professional that happens to cover biotechnology. Therefore, I give such a person's opinion a large amount of weight relative to other individuals who cover the space. Because after all, biotechnology is a space to itself, night and day from other industries in the market due to what drives the valuation. In my experience, it's by far the most controversial industry in the market, and in this second part of our interview, Dr. Jasuja is here to look at the industry's future, from a clinical perspective, with a Wall Street twist.</p><p><i>Part 2 begins where Part 1 ends; Dr. Jasuja was discussing the importance, or lack thereof, in interim results for immunotherapy-based endpoints. In Part 2 we begin with company analysis and outlooks for 2013.</i></p><p><b>Brian Nichols</b> <b>(BN)</b> - You cover <b>Galena Biopharma (GALE)</b> and issued a price target of $3.50, what do you think differentiates Galena from other immunotherapy companies? How did you arrive at your price target?</p><p><b>Dr. Rahul Jasuja (RJ)</b> - Galena is targeting a disease stage where cancer vaccines may work best-where the cancer is at its lowest burden or least aggressive, or earlier stages or after primary therapy/surgery. Patients with breast cancer undergo surgery; they are then in remission so to speak, there is no evidence of disease. Galena's vaccine is used in this setting to prevent disease recurrence. Note that the vaccine is not applicable to all patients afflicted with breast cancer - it only works in a subset. This disease setting is very different from <b>Dendreon (DNDN)</b> or <b>ImmunoCellular Therapeutics' (IMUC)</b> approach.</p><p>DNDN and IMUC are attacking cancer in the later stage, metastatic disease with high tumor burden. Prostate cancer is a slow growing cancer, so even if in later stage disease the immune response may have the ability to develop. Ideally immunotherapy is best administered at the earliest stages of cancer, like with Galena. Galena is treating patients who are in a &quot;wait-and-watch&quot; period, and there is nothing approved for many of these patients that addresses HER2 low expression. Only if patients are HER3+ can they receive Herceptin, but for those who are HER2 1+ or 2+ no therapy is approved, nothing targeting HER2. Since Galena's approach is in a minimal disease setting, an interim analysis makes more sense-that's when the immune response can develop and be effective. Phase 2 studies also showed efficacy at the interim analysis timeline.</p><p><b>BN</b> - The price target of $3.50 you set is lower than that of other analysts covering the stock; how do you see risk/reward for Galena?</p><p><b>RJ</b> - The reason I may have a lower rating on GALE (which is a &quot;Buy&quot;) is described in the risk section of my report. Even though the Phase 2 trials make a compelling case and were controlled, the study was not randomized and blinded. So other analysts who have it at $8.00 may have not have accounted for that or are less conservative - every analyst has his or her rationale. I may be more conservative; that's why my target is at $3.50.</p><p><b>BN</b> - A $3.50 price target would represent a market cap near $250 million, almost double its current price. If data is positive then how much is the company worth?</p><p><b>RJ</b> - I have a one-year $3.50 target based on rNPV (risk-adjusted net present value). If the 36-month data is positive then the company is worth several times more.</p><p><b>BN</b> - Assuming that NeuVax data is positive at 36 months and the company goes on to earn an FDA approval, what is its peak sales both used alone and used in conjunction with Herceptin?</p><p><b>RJ</b> - I have only looked at NeuVax alone as adjuvant therapy. If it makes it to market it could have peak sales of about $1.2 billion worldwide in the adjuvant setting based on my model.</p><p><b>BN</b> <i>-</i> Last year when I <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/614201-neuvax-developer-dr-peoples-eliminates-speculation-for-facts"">spoke with Dr. George Peoples</a>, he explained that because the Phase 3 trial will be using proper dosing levels, all patients will be receiving booster shots, having the right and same patient population, and because the Phase 3 plan was created based on the strengths of the Phase 2 trial, that the current study results could be better than the Phase 2 results. All of the factors noted were inconsistent during the Phase 2 trial, what are your thoughts?</p><p><b>RJ</b> - He makes an important point, but generally speaking one wants the Phase 2 trial design to reflect the Phase 3 trial design-except with a larger patient size. I can add to what Peoples may be referring to: One of the issues in breast cancer is that patients who are estrogen receptor negative are the tougher to treat. They are not responsive to most therapies. In the Phase 2 studies it was shown that the vaccine group included significantly more estrogen receptor negative patients. Therefore, more of this tough-to-treat population was in the vaccinated group versus the control arm-and by a statistically significant difference. In the Phase 3 trial this balance could make a large difference in the outcome of the trial.</p><p><b>BN</b> <i>-</i> I appreciate your thoughts on GALE, a stock that I cover, but right now I'd like to get your thoughts on some other developmental drugs. Earlier (Part 1) we essentially discussed the big name immunotherapies and the outlooks going forward. You seem excited about current and future development, but one negative has been Stimuvax. Why do you think that <b>Oncothyreon's (ONTY)</b> drug failed in Phase 3 trials?</p><p><b>RJ</b> - I didn't cover Stimuvax or the stock. I anticipated that Stimuvax was likely to fail. The reason that I thought it was going to fail is because the clinical trial started back in the early days of immunotherapy, back when our understanding of immunotherapy drug development was less mature. George Peoples' drug, NeuVax, also began development over a decade ago, but they learned along the way and it was developed adaptively for the right population, optimizing dosing and its booster etc. Stimuvax's approach was based on an older understanding of immunotherapy. Though I recall Merck KGA came in backed with good Phase 2 data. It seems like the Stimuvax approach lacked robust immune stimulation and Oncothyreon may be planning the next version of it with the addition of a potent immune modulator - though I have not followed it closely.</p><p><b>BN</b> - What would you say are the top catalysts for the early part of this year in immunotherapy? What are a couple of things that investors and the market will be watching?</p><p><b>RJ</b> - There is the GSK data in lung cancer with the MAGE- A3 vaccine that could be huge if positive. Just as big as Yervoy was. The development of PD-1 based approaches as we saw at ASCO are also important and very promising. I think <b>Vical's (VICL)</b> has a low probability of success, but I hope I am wrong. Vical uses naked DNA, and I am not sure there is enough cellular uptake. I am not too confident about Vical's prospects, but it would help immunotherapy if it did succeed.</p><p>I think it will be interesting to watch <b>NewLink Genetics (NLNK).</b> I have more confidence in Newlink's success, as their Phase 2 data looked robust. I would also look at Argos, which is a Phase 3 private company with a dendritic cell approach. Argos is starting a Phase 3 trial, tried to IPO last year. They have a sound scientific approach and a much-improved dendritic cell processing system compared to Dendreon. Also watch for ImmunoCellular Therapeutics and Galena. All different approaches.</p><p>Now, I do cover some other immunotherapy smaller cap companies such as <b>Inovio (INO)</b> and <b>OncoSec Medical (ONCS.OB)</b> that have a crucial year ahead. Both are not yet in Phase 3, but I think that in the next year we could see immune-based surrogate markers in their Phase 2 studies that equate with clinical benefit, Inovio for HPV and OncoSec for metastatic melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma. These will be meaningful for immunotherapy.</p><p><b>BN</b> - What is the most important catalyst that we need from immunotherapy in 2013?</p><p><b>RJ</b> - In general we want more predictable markers and endpoints for immunotherapy. If risk can be mitigated in predicting clinical success based on immune-based mechanisms, then Big Pharma and investors will be attracted. It would be nice to see Newlink succeed with its distinct approach using the allogeneic off-the-shelf tumor cells modified to induce a hyperacute immune response that connects innate with adaptive immunity. It would also be nice to see success in the autologous cellular-based immunotherapy space that beats Dendreon's less-than-fantastic commercial success. Autologous cell therapy approaches like Dendreon's may be less attractive to Big Pharma. This is due in part because of Dendreon's trouble and because the immunotherapy harvesting/cell culture drug approach doesn't really fit into many of Big Pharma's commercial business models at this time. If we see good efficacy coming from either Argos or ImmunoCellular Therapeutics it would make a huge difference for investor interest, and Big Pharma would start to pay closer attention.</p><p><b>BN</b> - You have talked about immunotherapy, both first and second generations. But what is something innovating right now that investors could maybe catch in its infancy? What is a third generation immunotherapy approach?</p><p><b>RJ</b> - I cover a few early-stage riskier immunotherapy companies that are promising and represent the next generation-OncoSec and Inovio for example. OncoSec Medical is developing a product that uses a well-known immunotherapy candidate, IL-12 protein, but it is too toxic to be given systemically. OncoSec delivers IL-12 DNA instead via electroporation. IL-12 DNA delivered locally in this manner for skin cancers is not toxic and its immune-modulatory potential in fighting tumors can be harnessed. When I was in academia I worked in a lab where I would collect blood samples from patients who had been given IL-12 systemically and the treatment would have modest efficacy, but was extremely harsh and toxic as it was given systemically -it would make patients weak, tired, sick, and would create the worst flu-like symptoms. So the quality of life is lousy. Thus, the potential to deliver IL-12 locally has major implications if it shows efficacy and safety in current studies. Unlike Vical, OncoSec uses electroporation to deliver a plasmid DNA, IL-12 in this case. The electroporation enhances cellular uptake that can lead to improved efficacy.</p><p><b>BN</b> - So in a sense it gives the positive effects of IL-12 without the negative side effects?</p><p><b>RJ</b> - Yes</p><p><span><strong>BN</strong> -</span> Do you have peak sales expectations for this product? Why is it such a cheap stock if it's so good?</p><p><b>RJ</b> - In a rough sense, peak sales for OncoSec could be in the range of what they are for Yervoy (over $1 billion as cited in Part 1) in the best-case scenario. That's a fair way to look at it. My analysis, in my report, is more conservative at this stage because it's still a novel technology. The stock is low because the technology is novel and riskier. The data is exciting, but we don't have a randomized controlled blinded large study that proves clinical effect. Early data in immunotherapy with novel technologies will always face this problem.</p><p><b>BN</b> - I thank you greatly for taking this time to speak with me about immunotherapy, is there anything else you would like to add in closing?</p><p><b>RJ</b> - There are many innovative approaches to immunotherapy that stretch beyond just dendritic cells or peptide vaccines or DNA-based plasmid for immune modulation. It's evolving quickly. We are learning more every day.</p><p><b>BN</b> - So what would be the key takeaway for someone interested in investing in this space?</p><p><b>RJ </b>-<b> </b>There will be failures before there is sustained success, as happens in any innovative drug development life cycle. In innovative drug development we &quot;fail forward towards success&quot;. Immunotherapy is risky, but the returns can be rewarding. Understand that cancer works very hard to mute the immune system. You may ask, &quot;Why does it do that?&quot; The answer is because the cancer &quot;knows&quot; that if the immune system works than cancer growth is aborted. Cancer uses a significant amount of energy to beat the immune system, and it uses several tricks to keep the immune system mute so that it can survive. This is why approaches using immunotherapy will be the ultimate Holy Grail for conquering cancer.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>You may not agree with all of Dr. Jasuja's outlooks and opinions, but hopefully you now understand how the immune system works and why immunotherapy is being used to treat cancer. Dr. Jasuja states very clearly that we are learning more every day and the space is evolving steadily. Whether you're bearish or bullish in your outlook, a company with a new approach might just have the key and succeed with a breakthrough in the space&hellip;or the opposite can happen. Therefore, I suggest using your own due diligence, assessing the space now that you know more, and continue to learn more about a space that is constantly evolving.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[GALE]], [[IMUC]].

"671441","2012-06-20 06:46:48","6 Stocks Trading With Momentum: Can It Continue?","<p>Over the last week the S&amp;P 500 has traded higher by 2.50%, and the technology heavy NASDAQ is up nearly 3.30% during the last three days. The markets are now at one month highs after pulling back from multi-year highs. And with investors expecting more measures from the Fed it is very possible that Tuesday becomes yet another day of large gains. As a result of large gains in the market, there have been a number of stocks to trade considerably higher. In terms of performance this has been a very rewarding month for my own portfolio, and chances are, your portfolio has performed with gains as well. With that being said I am taking a look at six stocks, in which I own, to determine whether or not the gains may continue or see a healthy pullback.</p><p>During the last month Sprint (S) has traded higher by 34%. Last week when the stock was priced at $2.96 I <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/657481-sprint-definitely-worth-watching-near-3"">mentioned</a> that it could be interesting if it surpassed $3, and could eventually reach $3.15 before resistance. Well, the stock has now reached $3.15 and I am going to stick to my original forecast, which means that I expect resistance to occur in the coming days. I think it could pullback and then struggle to trade higher for the next couple weeks. Over the last month Sprint along with AT&amp;T (T) and Verizon (VZ) have all seen large gains, and with very little in key developments. As a result it does appear as though each could trade lower. But then again, I could very well be wrong. So far I have been right about this stock, but it does have a lot of positive momentum and if it can clear $3.20 then it's nothing but blue skies ahead.</p><p>Over the last four days Alcatel-Lucent (ALU) has traded higher by 13% but is now reaching resistance at $1.70. The company has announced nothing but good news, yet hadn't traded with any level of momentum until now. The company's headquarters are in Europe, therefore I believe it has been kept down due to its presence in Europe alone, because fundamentally this stock is worth much more than its current valuation, yet I believe it will trade flat at this level due to resistance at $1.70. However, I must add, I have a long history of being wrong about ALU and its immediate trend. Therefore, the fact that I believe it will stall at $1.70 may be a good sign for ALU longs.</p><p>Questcor Pharmaceuticals (QCOR) is a stock that just keeps on surprising me. I have bought the stock about five times, and if I would have held since the first time I bought then I would be sitting on yacht somewhere in the Bahamas. However, it didn't work out, and I sold, only to buyback, most recently at $40, and the stock has been on a massive bull run ever since. QCOR has returned 33% over the last month alone. A large portion of its gains were leading up to the company's conference where it <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CFYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fquestcor-announces-initial-commercialization-plans-200000990.html&amp;ei=WljhT-fULefV0QGuhuzIAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFwtXcmO5BAHODm2eaii9vYcCvNSA&amp;sig2=FOKWSJYaJD2grfilt7atdg"">announced</a> commercialization plans for its blockbuster Acthar. However, as the company breaks into new highs on a daily basis, I do believe its run could be coming to an end. I think it may pullback over the next week as investors take profits. In the long run, there is still significant upside in this stock, but with a market-leading five year return of nearly 11,000% and a price/sales of 11.47 I believe a small pullback would be healthy. But then again, I constantly underestimate this stock, so nothing would surprise me.</p><p>Galena BioPharma (GALE) is a stock I first <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/333332-illogical-biotech-valuations-create-value-and-value-traps"">mentioned</a> back in January. The company's clinical <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/333332-illogical-biotech-valuations-create-value-and-value-traps"">results</a>, <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/333332-illogical-biotech-valuations-create-value-and-value-traps"">potentially</a> billions in sales, and market cap under $50 million just didn't add up, therefore I bought shares. However, it has been a bumpy ride, and although it has returned market leading gains in 2012 of nearly 250%, it is still far off its highs of $3.54. My goal with GALE is very simple, just ignore the volatility, hold tight, and if I am right then I will have the chance to make up for my decision to sale QCOR in 2010 (before buying back). The stock has been trading flat over the last month, but on Tuesday GALE traded higher by 22%, making its four day return 31%. The stock had created a bottom around $1.25 during the last six weeks. Therefore, all the investors who had been afraid of this stock after its incredible volatility, assumingly, began to buyback on Friday with the market trading higher, which means that I think this was just a correction. The stock traded higher after massive profit taking, and despite a 22% gain I still think it could go a little higher. But for those of you day trading or trying to ride momentum, then you better be careful. In my opinion, the only way to invest in developmental biotech is to go long and then close your eyes and hold on tight, these biotech roller coasters are often bumpy. But if you do your homework and buy a stock that truly presents value then it could be a great reward, leaving you fully satisfied after the ride ends.</p><p>Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (SPPI) has gained 16% over the last four days, therefore breaking through resistance at $12, and exceeding $13 per share. The rally was in large due to Zevalin <a href=""http://eon.businesswire.com/news/eon/20120618005593/en/ZEVALIN/European-Hematology-Association-Congress/refractory%2Frelapsed-aggressive-lymphoma"">data</a>, along with the fact that the stock is simply undervalued. SPPI is one of my favorite stocks in the market, and is trading with an unprecedented level of value for a biotechnology company with such a large pipeline, explosive growth, and three approved drugs (counting the <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/spectrum-pharmaceuticals-to-acquire-allos-therapeutics-acquisition-expected-to-be-accretive-on-a-cash-basis-in-q4-of-2012-2012-04-05"">acquisition</a> of Allos). Yet despite a P/E ratio of 10 and revenue growth of 130% along with explosive earnings growth I still think it will trade lower in the next couple days. SPPI is a heavily shorted stock (for some reason) and traded in a very volatile manner throughout the day on Tuesday. It opened lower, and had all the characteristics of a day where profit taking would occur, but then ended up trading higher. I have been following this stock for a long time, and I may be wrong, but it looks to have all the makings of a short period of profit taking.</p><p>XPO Logistics (XPO) has now seen two consecutive days of all-time highs, which means almost everyone has returned a gain from their investment. The stock has traded higher by 6% over the last three days since transferring its shares to the NYSE, and a 22% gain over the last month. Tuesday was particularly volatile for XPO, as it more than doubled its average volume, and then slightly fell throughout the day. However, I still think the stock trades higher throughout the remainder of this week, and ultimately surpasses $20. The reason is because the stock is currently being <a href=""http://www.russell.com/indexes/tools-resources/reconstitution/reconstitution-changes.asp"">accumulated</a> by both the Russell Global and Russell 3000 indexes, which has more than $100 billion that track the indexes combined. The accumulation period will continue throughout this week, and I believe will push shares even higher. Honestly, I believe my $20 target is relatively small. The stock has an average price target of $23.25 among six analysts, including Jefferies calling it a potential 'four-bagger&quot; with an eventual $70 price target.</p><p>Hopefully, the performance of everyone's portfolio has been stellar over the last week. There is no doubt that the last two days of last week should have consisted of loss with the Greek election characterized by so much uncertainty. Yet markets have traded higher, presenting an unusual amount of confidence, and turned out to be a pleasant surprise for investors who held tight. Regardless of the market's immediate direction I plan to hold all my positions, the ones above plus others. Because in this market there are no guarantees, you may think a stock will retrace but then it trades 10% higher. Therefore, I believe the best investment strategy in this market is to be long, because there is unprecedented value, and if you hold through the ups and downs it is sure to pay off.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[ALU]], [[SPPI]], [[S]], [[XPO]], [[QCOR]], [[GALE]].</p><p><strong>Additional disclosure:</strong> The material in this piece is intended for educational purposes only and the opinions should not be used for any investment decisions.</p>"
"1038051","2012-11-30 11:00:07","Small Market Cap Pharmaceuticals With Large Catalysts Looming In 2013","<p>Investors who chose to open positions in development-phase pharmaceuticals are typically willing to accept more risk than traditional investors. The latter often utilizes the traditional P/E (Price/Earning) algorithms, revenue generation, profit generation, dividend payout, technical analyses and other means to determine stock quality. It is for these reasons that traditional investors would run from virtually all development-phase pharma. However, for those willing to expose themselves to the risks, these small gems can score the lucky and wise investors huge returns on their investments. Throwing conventional wisdom out the window, small pharma investors rather base their investment decisions on potential targeted patient group size, odds of the companies successfully completing the many steps in the regulatory process, propensity of dilutive financing, possibilities of partnerships and likelihood of company buyout. Wise decisions can yield returns of many multiples on their initial investment.</p><p>Alternately, for each success story in the sector, there are many failures. Small market cap companies have more associated risks that are inherent to most development stage entities. The additional risks are what often keep the share prices depressed until the associated companies begin proving themselves via clinical data and solid press releases. It is then that share prices often begin their upward progression as more investors take note. With an unbelievable number of development-phase pharmaceuticals publicly traded, the required research to find solid, investment quality candidates can be a formidable task. Over the last year or so, I have come across a few such possibilities that I believe can offer large returns on initial investments with smaller downside risks than their peers as these companies are beginning to prove themselves through clinical trials with solid and real results.</p><p><strong>OncoSec Medical (ONCS.OB)</strong> is a young company just beginning to come into its own this year. Its platform is based on technology it <a href=""http://ir.inovio.com/index.php?s=43%26item=17"">licensed from Inovio Pharmaceuticals</a> (INO) in March of 2011. The license involves &quot;certain non-DNA vaccine technology and intellectual property relating to electroporation technology useful for electrochemical and cytokine based immune therapies for treating solid tumors.&quot; Electroporation involves applying an electrical current across targeted cancer tissue, which causes a large increase (up to 10,000-fold) in the cell membranes' porosity. This allows a much higher level of previously injected agents (chemotherapy or immunotherapy-based) to enter the cells' interiors where they are trapped, once the electrical current is removed, and the cell membranes return to their initial state.</p><p>OncoSec has made the most of its investment as it has begun presenting its findings for Phase II trials of the electroporation-based ImmunoPulse therapies for skin cancers. The ImmunoPulse treatment incorporates DNA IL-12, a plasmid DNA construct with instructions for the treated cells to produce the IL-12 cytokine. Once inside the cells, the agent causes them to produce the IL-12 cytokine, a trigger for the immune system to attack the cells with this type of protein expression. On October 23 the company announced <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-medical-incorporated-reports-positive-preliminary-efficacy-and-safety-results-from-phase-ii-study-of-immunopulse-in-merkel-cell-carcinoma-patients"">interim results</a> of its <span>Phase II trial for using ImmunoPulse to treat patients with Merkel cell carcinoma ((MCC)). The overall response rate ((ORR)) for the small, five patient trial was 20% with the procedure being described as safe and well tolerated. There was no indicated systemic or residual toxicity. Of the three patients completing the trial, each had elevated levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12) in biopsied tissue three weeks after treatment, demonstrating the effectiveness of the procedure to induce the interleukin's expression by the targeted cancer tissue. This expression is used to cause an immune response by killer CD8+ T-cells against the IL-12 expressed cells. Additional data will be available in 2013 and will provide investors with more catalysts in the coming months. Following up the October news, the company presented data at a melanoma conference on <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-medical-reports-positive-preliminary-efficacy-results-from-phase-ii-study-of-immunopulse-in-metastatic-melanoma-patients"">November 15th</a> where it presented <span>Phase II interim data of its ImmunoPulse platform in treating the larger indication metastatic melanoma. With thirteen patients enrolled at the time of data analysis, only certain patients were evaluable at three defined time frames. At day 39, thirteen patients were available for analysis with 5% having progressive disease ((PD)), 14% with stable disease ((SD)), 42% having partial response ((PR)) and 39% having complete response ((CR)). At day 90, nine patients were available for analysis with 5% having ((PD)), 50% with ((PR)) and 45% having complete response . At day 180, two patients were eligible for evaluation of the primary endpoint of objective overall response. One patient had a stable disease designation and the other patient had complete response of all treated and untreated lesions. Investors should understand that the untreated lesions were being attacked by the patient's immune system as it had learned from the directly-treated tumors that the tissue type was foreign and should be attacked according. This sort of immune response is critical as if much of the patient set demonstrates such a systemic immune response; the platform could very well be construed as a safe and effective therapy for treating metastatic melanoma and provide for much possible upside for the company's shares from current levels.</p><p>Interested investors should perform much research into the company's potential and watch for upcoming updates in both the <span>Phase II metastatic melanoma and the Merkel cell carcinoma trials, which could both be possible share price drivers in the coming months. More immediately they should also be looking for updates on the company's newly given permission to market its electroporation platform (also termed OncoSec Medical System, or OMS) via <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-receives-ce-mark-for-its-electroporation-device"">CE mark allowance</a> announced on October 17th. This allows for the marketing of the device in the 30 nations of the European Economic Area ((EEA)) and Switzerland. The company hasn't yet announced plans on how it might market the device, but a partnership or licensing agreement seems to be the most obvious options for this microcap, development-phase company with a current market capitalization of $27 million. Additional catalysts include possible licensing or other type of partnership of the company's NeoPulse platform. In an <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/896721-interview-with-oncosec-ceo-punit-dhillon"">October 1st interview</a>, OncoSec CEO Punit Dhillon, indicated that the company is focusing its resources on the ImmunoPulse platform and meanwhile looking for partners for its NeoPulse (electroporation platform using the chemotherapy agent, bleomycin as it treatment agent). For more information on the NeoPulse platform, please see the <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-oms-electrochemotherapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-shows-enhanced-quality-of-life-in-two-randomized-phase-iii-studies""><span>Phase III data presented in July</a> of this year and <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-medical-reports-positive-interim-efficacy-results-from-phase-iv-study-of-neopulse-in-skin-cancer-patients""><span>Phase IV data presented in mid November</a>. Any of these latter catalysts can represent solid upside potential for this company. Investors should always consider the risks associated with OTCBB-listed companies and perform considerable research into the trial data, company financials (still considered a development-phase company despite its mark CE allowance in the EEA) and targeted indications before opening any sort of position in this company.</p><p><strong>Celsion Corporation's (CLSN)</strong> platform is based also on targeted delivery of cancer fighting agents to the tumor site. Termed its ThermoDox technology, the premise behind the treatment is the encapsulation of cancer-fighting agents in Lysolipid Thermally Sensitive Liposomes (LTSLs). These are oily molecules (lipids) that contain cancer-fighting agents in their interior. The molecules naturally accumulate at cancer tumors which have leaky vascular (vessels) and are more prone to permeation via liposomes. The liposomes are delivered into the patient's body where they are allowed to accumulate at the tumor sites for a predetermined period of time. The targeted tissue is then heated to 42C over a period of 40 minutes via external devices such as radiofrequency thermal ablation ((RFA)), microwave hyperthermia or high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Current trials utilize RFA as their heat source. The elevated temperature serves two purposes. First, it increases the &quot;leakiness&quot; or permeability of the vessels in and around the tumor allowing additional LTSLs to accumulate. Primarily, however, the temperature changes the structure of the liposomes allowing its payload to be released at the tumor site. This increases the effectiveness of the therapy and also improves the safety profile of the treatment as it reduces systemic exposure to the drug. Current trials each use the chemotherapy agent, doxorubicin.</p><p>Although the company has two <span>Phase II trials underway evaluating ThermoDox to treat breast cancer recurrences at the chest wall (<a href=""http://investor.celsion.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=710275"">the DIGNITY study</a>) and colorectal liver metastases (<a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01464593?term=ThermoDox%26rank=4"">the ABLATE study</a>), it is the <span>Phase III trial evaluating the therapy in treating primary liver cancer (<a href=""http://investor.celsion.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=720097"">the HEAT study</a>) that has been the predominant share price driver in 2012. The company's shares are up an astounding 340+% YTD with the company's shares recently becoming increasingly bullish with shares up over 72% in November alone. Early in the month the company announced that it had reached <a href=""http://investor.celsion.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=720097"">380 events of progression</a> which now allow for unblinding of the placebo-controlled, double-blind trial's data, collection of the final data and then subsequent data analysis. The company plans on releasing topline results in January of 2013 with huge ramifications if data are indeed positive. The <span>Phase III trial has Fast Track Designation from the FDA and has received Orphan Drug Designation in both the U.S. and Europe, protecting the company's platform for primary liver disease from competition and increasing its profitability for up to 7 years after the approval date. Additionally, positive data would also serve to validate the company's platform and give evidence of use for other indications.</p><p>2013 could very well be an exciting year for Celsion shareholders with <span>Phase III topline results release for ThermoDox schedule for January, the FDA's PDUFA regulatory decision date pending and updates on its two <span>Phase II trials. Even at the current elevated levels, the company's market capitalization is still only $265 million, offering much upside potential if events unfold positively for the company in the coming weeks. However, investors are advised to consider the downside possibilities as failure to meet primary endpoints would be a devastating blow to the company with lost money, lost time and possible invalidated pipeline in a worst case scenario.</p><p><strong>AEterna Zentaris (AEZS)</strong> long-time shareholders have had a miserable 2012 relative to the other two presented companies in this piece. The company's share price is down on a reverse-split adjusted basis of over 75% YTD with a year of devastating news behind it. On April 2nd the company and its development partner, Keryx Biopharmaceuticals (KERX), announced topline results for the <span>Phase III trial of Perifosine for refractory advanced colorectal cancer. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint of improving overall survival versus capecitabine + placebo. At the opening bell, AEterna shares traded at $4.38, down over 65% from the previous day's close. However, shares would continue trending down over the next few months necessitating a 6:1 reverse split on October 3rd in order to remain in compliance with NASDAQ's listing requirements. A subsequent offering announced October 11th for <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/aeterna-zentaris-prices-offering-at-20-discount-2012-10-12?link=MW_latest_news"">$16.5 million</a> at $2.50 per share, a 20% discount to the previous day's close, pushed shares down again from the closing price of $3.12 on the 11th to close at $2.43 on the 12th. Shares trended down from there even to breach the $2.00 psychological support level before returning above $2.00 where they now trade.</p><p>AEterna Zentaris' value and upside potential for 2013 may not be significant for the long-term shareholders of AEterna. However, I believe upside potential is there for new shareholders taking advantage of the recent dips and even entry at the current share price. Although Perifosine failed to meet its goal in the advanced colorectal cancer trial, the company is continuing the development of the drug in an ongoing <span>Phase III trial for treating multiple myeloma. The company took over the <span>Phase III trial from Keryx, and is planning on releasing interim data on 1Q 2013 according to the company's <a href=""http://www.aezsinc.com/pdfdyn/PR-Q2%202012-ENG.pdf"">Q2, 2012 filing</a> per the statement &quot;Company took over the ongoing <span>Phase III trial in multiple myeloma from Keryx, with a pre-planned interim analysis expected in Q1 2013.&quot; The recent <a href=""http://www.aezsinc.com/en/page.php?p=60%26q=543"">Q3, 2012 filing</a> gave a bit more information on the <span>Phase III trial noting, &quot;Pre-planned interim analysis by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (&quot;DSMB&quot;) expected upon reaching approximately 80 events (disease progression or death).&quot;</p><p>Another catalyst for 2013 includes the Q1, 2013 initiation of a <span>Phase III trial of AEZS-108 for treating endometrial cancer. The company expects to hear back in Q4 of this year on the FDA's decision of whether to grant the trial its Special Protocol Assessment ((SPA)) guidance for the trial. If given, this would provide the company a more clear-cut path through the regulatory process by giving goals via primary and secondary endpoints that, if met, would allow for marketing approval in the U.S. AEterna also intends to file for a New Drug Application ((NDA)) in Q1, 2013 for AEZA-130. The product candidate is not being evaluated as a drug for this NDA but rather an oral diagnostic tool to test for adult growth hormone deficiency (&quot;AGHD&quot;), a condition that affects 35,000 adult Americans, with 6,000 additional adults diagnosed each year.</p><p>With the recent offering minimizing the need for additional offerings, the company ended Q3 with about $33.2 million in cash and equivalents. The reverse split keeps the company in compliance with NASDAQ's listing requirements where it will likely remain, pending unforeseen negative catalysts in 2013. The company appears to have a lot going for it currently with an exciting, catalyst-filled 2013 ahead. Interested investors should perform much research into this company's financials. It does have one marketed product in Cetrotide the first luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonist treatment approved for in-vitro fertilization, however the company is still operating at a loss. Recent share price dips, and even the current levels just over $2.2 offer new investors good entry into what could be exciting times ahead yet again for this currently downtrodden and forgotten company.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in [[ONCS.OB]], [[AEZS]] over the next 72 hours.

"1067081","2012-12-16 11:50:39","As Stevia Grows In Acceptance, Companies And Investors May Find Sweet Rewards","<p>Last week (December 7-14, 2012) was a good week for the stevia industry in general. First, <a href=""http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/consult/steviol/document-consultation-eng.php"">Health Canada</a> approved the use of stevia as an additive in food and beverage products across Canada. Next, Cargill announced an exclusive strategic agreement with <a href=""http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1087835/truvia-business-to-expand-global-presence-through-exclusive-distribution-with-grupo-herdez-in-mexico-and-market-opening-in-canada"">Grupo Herdez</a>, one of the leading producers of shelf stable foods in Mexico, for the distribution and marketing of <a href=""http://www.truvia.com/"">Truvia</a> sweetener throughout Mexico. Grupo Herdez will contribute its local marketing expertise to the Truvia brand to build consumer awareness through advertising and in-store campaigns. Europe has also seen growth in stevia ever since the <a href=""http://www.nutritionaloutlook.com/news/stevia-approved-europe"">European Commission</a> authorized its use in 2011. According to the <a href=""http://www.globalissues.org/news/2012/09/26/14897"">European Stevia Association</a> [EUSTAS], stevia farms have begun to sprout up in Spain. SteviGran, which operates stevia farms in Paraguay and Granada Spain, and De Primera, cultivates 15 hectares of land dedicated to growing stevia. According to Miguel Arrillage, the owner of De Primera:</p><blockquote class=""quote""><p>The demand for stevia is exploding... The next step is to install a stevioside extraction plant in southern Spain, using ecological processes.</p></blockquote><p>Through a podcast posted on Nov. 28th Euromonitor International Ingredients analyst <a href=""http://blog.euromonitor.com/2012/11/stevia-successful-in-2012.html"">Lauren Bandy</a> commented on the global state of stevia when she stated, &quot;We can finally call stevia a mainstream ingredient&quot;. Ms. Bandy pointed out that stevia consumption in soft drinks doubled from 2011 to 2012, from 460 tons to over 1000 tons globally, and sales of stevia are forecasted to grow 30% from 2011 to 2016. The largest market for stevia is the US, where more than half of the product was consumed, followed by Japan, China and France. Stevia production continues to expand globally; Canada, Spain and Mexico are current examples.</p><p>How does an investor profit from the growing stevia market? The giant bottlers are far too large to expect stevia to drive their stocks up, as are other large manufacturers such as Kraft (KFT), with its new natural stevia-based Crystal light Pure. However, there are companies that these giant bottlers and food manufactures will have to rely on for growing, producing, and distributing stevia products globally, and some of these companies might be good investments for a stevia play.</p><p><strong>Grupo Herdez </strong>(GUZOF.PK), as stated above, entered the stevia business when it announced a strategic partnership with Cargill to distribute Truvia throughout Mexico. This should be a good mix for both companies, given Grupo Herdez's presence in Mexico and its lead position in the Mexican food category in the in the U.S. Chairman and CEO of Grupo Herdez, Hector Hernandez-Pons, commented on his excitement of adding Truvia to their premium product line:</p><blockquote class=""quote""><p>The demand for a calorie-free sweetener from a natural source has grown with consumers' expectations around understanding the source of their food. Our strategic agreement with the Truvia&reg; business, the leader in its category, will keep our products relevant to consumers by acknowledging their needs and preferences.</p></blockquote><p>Grupo Herdez has 13 plants, 8 distribution centers, 7 tuna vessels and more than 6,000 employees. It distributes a wide array of more than 500 food and beverage products, and its portfolio includes Aires de Campo, Barilla, Chi-Chi's, Del Fuerte, Don Miguel, Dona Maria, Embasa, Herdez, La Victoria, McCormick, Wholly Guacamole and now Truvia.</p><p>Grupo Herdez is a $1.22 billion market cap company based in Mexico. It has had solid gains on the Mexican Stock Exchange this year, with decent volume averaging just over 300 thousand shares traded per day. However, the US ADR's have very little volume and not much movement. Earlier this year, Standard &amp; Poor's, and <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/GUZBY.PK/key-developments/article/2601224"">Fitch Ratings</a> both affirmed long-term <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/GUZBY.PK/key-developments/article/2602678"">corporate credit ratings</a> at AA(mex) on the Mexican national scale, with the outlook of Stable. If one is looking to invest in a company on the Mexican Stock Exchange, Grupo Herdez is a stable company and a good long-term investment. As a play in the future growth of stevia, I think the best it can do is open new routes and introduce the country of Mexico (with 10% of its population suffering from <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/88951.php"">diabetes</a>) to the natural zero calorie sugar substitute stevia.</p><p><strong>Reed's Inc. (REED)</strong>, a small boutique, natural beverage company based in Los Angeles, CA, has had quite a run - up 385% YTD, and that's after the stock had been hammered in the past month, down almost 30%. Reed's carries a line of natural sodas including <a href=""http://www.reedsinc.com/our-products/"">Reed s Ginger Brews</a>, made with fresh ginger root, spices, and fruit juices, Virgil's natural sodas, including a brewed root beer, and a real cola. Reeds also carries through Virgil's a zero calorie line, featuring root beer, cream soda, and Dr. Better, all infused with Stevia. Consumers are buying its products, as Reed's announced 3rd quarter <a href=""http://www.dailypolitical.com/finance/stock-market/reeds-reed-posts-quarterly-earnings-results-beats-expectations-by-0-02-eps.htm"">revenues</a> were up 23% compared to 2011, with sales at $7.9 million, beating consensus estimates of $6.4 million. Gross profit increased 21% from 2011 to $2.5 million, and net income for the 2012 second quarter was $22,000 compared to a loss of $175,000 a year earlier.</p><p>Reed's, a $64 million market cap company, is growing, and may be moving beyond just a niche market for those who want a quality, flavorful, natural sodas, and are willing to pay a premium. The company recently launched its Culture Club Kombucha line of drinks nationwide. Chris Reed, founder and CEO, commented on the launch:</p><blockquote class=""quote""><p>The launch of our new Culture Club Kombucha has exceeded our expectations. According to recent syndicated data, the functional juices and Kombucha category has surpassed $609 million and is the fastest growing category at +35% retail dollar growth. In our early store-by-store analysis, we are finding that our four Kombucha flavors are tracking to outsell our top four Reed's and Virgil's SKUs. Consumer and retailer feedback has been extremely positive to date and we intend to capitalize on the feedback and the opportunity to build Culture Club Kombucha into a national, dominant player within this fast-expanding category.</p></blockquote><p>Recently Reed's entered into distribution partnerships with Central Beverage of Chicago, Geyser Beverage of the San Francisco, Zip Beverage of Montana, and Tops Friendly Markets with locations in upstate NY and PA. They also attended the Natural Products Expo Asia show to introduce Reed's and Virgil's products to the Asian market. With Reed's products expanding, and its zeal for natural ingredients, this company, which has seen its stock shoot up from $1.10 per share in January, appears to be primed to grow further and might take a big chunk out of the natural sugar free beverage market with its stevia-infused product line. What I like is that the stock has dipped considerably since its high of $8.82, and now at $5.36 a share, is more in line as a possible entry point.</p><p>Stevia First Corp. (STVF.OB), a development stage stevia production and manufacturing company based in Yuba City, CA, is developing seeds and tissue high in Rebaudioside A (Reb A), the sweetest of the steviol glycosides (extracts from the plant's leaves). On Tuesday, the company announced its determination to act in concert with USDA-funded researchers by providing plant material, logistical support, and sites for ongoing stevia field trials. Stevia First is focused on being an advocate of the USDA's <a href=""http://ir4.rutgers.edu/"">Specialty Crops Project</a>, and believes supporting the project is important to successful domestic stevia cultivation.</p><p>One reason is that in 2010, roughly 50,000 acres of stevia were grown globally, and less than 1% of that was grown in the U.S. Stevia First plans on changing that by developing and growing quality stevia on its 1000-acre industrial farmland. The USDA's Specialty Crops Project has the capability to lend support to industry and academic sponsors and work directly with agrochemical companies enabling the approval of safe and effective conventional and organic agrochemicals for stevia growers across the US. Stevia First's CEO Robert Brooke commented:</p><blockquote class=""quote""><p>We are seeking to develop a reliable and scalable North American supply chain of stevia products. Development of integrated pest management tools is critical in our effort to produce conventional and organic California grown stevia leaf.</p></blockquote><p>The company has been making some noise lately on its methods of producing high-grade stevia. It plans on catering to the ever-growing organic market by becoming the first industrial size organic stevia grower in the U.S. It is also developing a conventional stevia product through a yeast based <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/stevia-first-corp-licenses-fermentation-130000528.html"">fermentation process</a> which makes it possible to convert the low-cost plant material into sweet steviol glycosides through controlled fermentation methods, thus bypassing or significantly reducing the need for leaf production. This could enable the company to develop new strains of the Reb A that would be sweeter while removing any negative characteristics of the steviol glycosides, including the lingering aftertaste. Once operational, Stevia First expects the fermentation process to lower the cost of stevia production by 70% compared to planting the seedlings in the ground and harvesting and extracting the Reb A. Therefore, its fermentation process should be able to produce the product at a far less cost with a lot more control of the product's most desirable characteristics than the other stevia growers around the world.</p><p>Stevia First is a microcap development company, with a market cap of $20 million, and is in its early stages of developing and producing its stevia products. It has no sales to date, and it doesn't expect to have its product on the market for another year and a half, as it focuses on developing the highest quality stevia extracts to bring to market. But I like where this company is heading, as it is focusing its entire efforts in developing one of the fastest growing food products on the market today - stevia. As noted earlier in the article, stevia continues to expand globally and is still in its early stages of acceptance, so Stevia First does not see a need to rush its development, but rather, be certain it is developing a high quality product that will propel the company forward. Stevia First has seen its stock fluctuate this year, from the low $0.20s to $3.28 per share. Today, it hovers around $0.37, and may represent a great entry price for investors' interested in the company's growth. I do like the fact the company announced plans to work with the USDA's Specialty Crops Project, as it helps bolster confidence by developing stevia plants and plant material in one of the most fertile growing regions of the country - California's central valley.</p><p>As more people in more countries learn about stevia and welcome it as their choice for a natural zero calorie sugar substitute, I look for not just stevia growers and producers to have a windfall of profits, but for companies who incorporate stevia in their products, such as Reed's. But I caution, microcap stocks can be volatile, they offer huge upside potential and corresponding downside risks. The companies offered here appear to have good current-level entries for various levels of risk. Interested investors are advised to perform additional research to determine which, if any, of these fit their long-term goals.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[STVF.OB]].

The patent provides exclusivity in Japan until 2022, which is a big step to go along with recent developments surrounding <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/galena-biopharma-issued-neuvax-tm-110500158.html"">additional patents</a> for the company in the U.S. for NeuVax. Galena's CEO, Dr. Mark Ahn, has often explained his goal is to expand the company's intellectual property portfolio. Although I am not sure how this particular patent fits into the strategy, it still adds value to the company, and I am certain that it is part of the bigger picture.</p><p>Up until this point, all of Galena's 230% YTD gains have been a result of its Phase III NeuVax vaccine for the treatment of breast cancer. In fact, some often forget about the company's other targeted vaccine, E39. The <a href=""http://www.galenabiopharma.com/pipeline#fbp"">E39 vaccine</a> targets Folate Binding Protein, which is over-expressed in ovarian, endometrial, and breast cancers. The company's goal is to prove that its E39 vaccine will be effective in treating the recurrence of these diseases, which would create significant upside value. This potential is in addition to NeuVax, a vaccine with great clinical results that is attacking the significant unmet medical need of low and medium expression HER2 tumors in breast cancer patients. If successful, Neuvax could return billions in annual sales.</p><p>Galena's strategy as a biotechnology company is much different than most. Over the last couple of years, Folate has become a very popular <a href=""http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=207300"">choice</a> as a cancer target. Yet, Galena is different because it is using its peptide vaccine to prevent recurrence and is <a href=""http://investors.galenabiopharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=648370"">currently</a> in Phase I/II studies to prevent recurrence in ovarian and endometrial cancers. Meanwhile, companies such as ImmunoGen (IMGN) are using a folate <a href=""http://investor.immunogen.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=690795"">targeted</a> monoclonal antibody, which is in Phase I of development for previously treated ovarian cancer, NSCLC or other epithelial malignancies that over-express FOLR1 (folate receptor alpha). There are also countless other companies in early stages using folate, but Galena appears to be the only one using it to prevent recurrence, which gives the company a unique market opportunity moving forward.</p><p>I have often called Galena the &quot;little brother of ImmunoGen.&quot; Obviously, it would be a much smaller brother, as Galena trades with a market cap of just over $100 million and ImmunoGen typically maintains a valuation of near or over $1 billion. However, there are a lot of similarities between the two companies: Galena's Phase III candidate, NeuVax, is being developed to prevent breast cancer in patients who are HER2 IHC 1+,2+ (low-intermediate levels). Meanwhile, Immunogen has T-DM1 (Transtuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1), a Phase III candidate targeting HER 2 IHC 3+ in patients with metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after treatment with Herceptin. And as I mentioned, both companies have an FBP, for different purposes that treat different indications, with ImmunoGen's being a Phase I candidate and Galena's being a Phase I/II. Therefore, despite the fact that both target cancer in different ways, the technology is somewhat similar -- maybe not exact, but definitely enough to draw a comparison.</p><p>My goal has always been to try and put valuations into perspective. It is difficult to compare two biotechnology companies; however, you can sometimes pair companies and determine whether or not a company is undervalued based on its peers. ImmunoGen is a great company, and will most likely earn an approval for its Phase III candidate. At this year's ASCO, the company was <a href=""http://investor.immunogen.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=679341"">considered</a> a big winner after reaching its interim endpoint in the EMELIA study; leaving most to believe that it will achieve an FDA approval. On the other hand, there is Galena, a much smaller company that is slightly behind ImmunoGen in the approval process. Galena is about 18 months behind ImmunoGen, and is not expected to release its interim data until sometime in 2013.</p><p>Back on May 1, before ImmunoGen announced its interim data, the company was valued at $975 million, as investors expected strong results. Over the following two months, the stock traded in an uptrend, due to strong clinical data, and reached a valuation of $1.4 billion by the start of July. If the company wouldn't have announced a public offering, it would most likely still be trading with a valuation near $1.5 billion. The reason for the valuation is because investors now expect the company to thrive if approved. After meeting its interim endpoint, investors are confident that its studies will be a success and that ImmunoGen can enter a multi-billion dollar space with an effective treatment.</p><p>At this point, I don't think anyone doubts that T-DM1 will be approved or that ImmunoGen is a great company with a breakthrough technology; however, valuation can often hurt a stock, and investors. Most likely, T-DM1 will be a breakthrough drug; it could reach sales in excess of $5 billion, perhaps even $6 billion. The problem is that it could take four to five years to reach the peak sales, and ImmunoGen only earns a royalty rate of 5% through its partnership with Genentech. Therefore, $300 million is ImmunoGen's max in terms of revenue from sales (most likely). Although it will have particularly high margins, it will be important that the drug expands into first-line breast cancer, and that the company develops its folate candidate so that it can create additional revenue, which I believe, is where the true value lies for this company.</p><p>I believe ImmunoGen could reach a valuation of $4.5 billion at some point in the next five years, based on net income of $180 million, trading at 25x earnings, which would be expensive, but should be expected in an overvalued biotechnology space. Hence, over a period of several years, the stock could present significant long-term upside. If it meets such high expectations, and can reach profit margins between 50%-60%, the valuation is most likely attainable. A lot of questions still remain. If T-DM1 does not live up to high expectations, and only reaches sales of $3 billion, then ImmunoGen would be significantly overvalued, and would not be presenting much in terms of upside from its current price.</p><p>Right now, it's difficult to predict the strength of sales for T-DM1, as we must also account for competition with other drugs, such as GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Tykerb, and any newer drugs that may come behind it, or currently approved drugs that may seek second-line breast cancer therapy as an indication. Galena, on the other hand, is in Phase III studies with its candidate NeuVax and is not competing with these drugs, as its vaccine is aimed at preventing recurrence -- and so far, it has been effective.</p><p>In Galena's <a href=""http://investors.galenabiopharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=680008"">Phase II study</a> of nearly 200 patients, the company met its primary endpoint of disease-free survival. In the vaccinated group, at both 24 and 36 months, the recurrence rates were 0% versus 22% for the control group. And at 60 months, the vaccinated group reflected a recurrence rate of 5.6% compared to 25.9% in the control group. Now, the company will more than triple the size of its study in the Phase III PRESERVE trial, but its endpoint of disease-free survival will remain the same. This is a major win for the company, as its goal is to have comparable numbers on a larger scale.</p><p>If approved, Galena's NeuVax has the potential to reach sales comparable to ImmunoGen's T-DM1, or perhaps even more because of the additional uses of NeuVax. It is currently being tested alone in the Phase III trial, in combination with Herceptin, and as booster shots, which could provide significant long-term revenue if approved. In all three studies, the group with NeuVax showed significant progress in terms of disease-free survival. Now, with the Phase III clinical in full swing, the company is <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/525841-mark-ahn-interview-neuvax-demonstrated-preclinical-and-clinical-benefit-in-all-levels-of-her2-expression"">expected</a> to announce interim data sometime in 2013. If the data is positive, this $100 million company could continue its rally, to a large degree, as it's already traded higher by 230% in 2012.</p><p>The bottom line is that T-DM1 is all but a guaranteed FDA approval, but still faces challenges due to a wide range of revenue possibilities. The stock could very well be significantly overvalued and never post revenue in excess of $100 million, or it could reach sales of nearly $300 million, yielding upside potential of 300%. The range is wide. Galena is a bit riskier, as its FDA approval is not a guarantee. However, it did have positive results in a large Phase II trial, and I see no reason to suggest that its Phase III trial will not produce similar results; and if so, then an FDA approval may be imminent. As a result, it's a situation of risk vs. reward; and considering its current valuation and its clinical results, the risk is small, but the reward could be significant.</p><p>As for now, Galena is still behind ImmunoGen in the clinical process, but with all things considered, I don't believe it's so far behind that it validates a market capitalization of roughly 10% of ImmunoGen's. Both companies are attempting to aid in the fight against breast cancer, and both show significant advantages over standard of care treatments. ImmunoGen's interim results were very impressive, and Galena is looking to nicely complement ImmunoGen as it enters a space with a large unmet medical need.</p><p>Despite the questions, there is a lot of potential for Galena in the space. When you consider that both companies have a folate candidate, the potential for ImmunoGen to enter first-line therapy, and Galena to market NeuVax alone or in combination with Herceptin, the sky looks to be the limit. And because of valuation, and ImmunoGen's partnership, I'd say that most upside would be speculative, and will occur in the next year in anticipation of an FDA approval. However, Galena could very well trade with significant gains if it continues to meet its endpoint (which was met in Phase II), and close the gap over the next year as the company updates investors on the trial and prepares to release interim data that will forever change its future, one way or the other.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[GALE]], and may initiate a long position in [[IMGN]] over the next 72 hours.

"1724862","2013-10-02 08:19:53","Investing Smart: Biotechs, Effective Therapies And Shareholder-Friendly CEOs","<p>There are many ways to invest in the clinical biotechnology space. You can invest in a clinical company during its early stages, while crossing your fingers that it becomes Acadia Pharmaceuticals and not Vical. Yet, my personal preference has always been to invest in such companies that have a good story, investor focused leadership, and are so cheap compared to potential that a pre-data rally is almost certain. Personally, I have executed this strategy successfully with countless biotechs, such as <b>Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ)</b>, <b>Questcor Pharmaceuticals (QCOR), Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (SPPI)</b> and, most recently, <b>NeoStem (NBS)</b>, <b>NewLink Genetics (NLNK)</b>, <b>Galena Biopharma (GALE)</b>, and <b>ImmunoCellular Therapeutics (IMUC).</b></p> <p>Now, while I have also had some failures as well, for the most part I have been successful. And the one thing I seek more so than anything else is a shareholder-friendly CEO, although it is arguable as to whether Spectrum's &quot;Raj&quot; would fit in this category. One of my favorites is Dr. Manish Singh, formerly of ImmunoCellular. Singh has a strong scientific background with over 10 patents under his belt, he's someone I've spoken with a half dozen times, and he knows how to create shareholder value.</p> <p><b>Abrupt Resignation &amp; New Transition</b></p> <p>Dr. Singh's <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/818471-immunocellular-ceo-steps-down-but-leaves-company-well-positioned"">resignation from ImmunoCellular</a> last year was very abrupt and never fully explained publicly. To those such as myself, it appeared that ICT-107 was a homerun. So why would Singh walk away from such a potential success? Seriously, ICT-107 treated a disease in glioblastoma multiforme ((GBM)) that is considered one of the most deadly to man (late-stage brain cancer). Newly diagnosed patients have a life <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15758009"">expectancy</a> of just 15 months (median overall survival) and just 16% of patients live to see three years. Yet, ICT-107 did something that might be considered (dare I say) a CURE! Not only was ICT-107's median overall <a href=""http://propthink.com/investors-discounting-positive-data-read-out-on-brain-cancer-studies/4943"">survival</a> 38 months, but more than half of patients lived three years or beyond.</p> <p>When we look at the structure of ICT-107, it is easy to see why the therapy was such a success. It is an immunotherapy, <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/832591-ict-107-into-perspective-part-2"">very similar</a> to <b>Dendreon's</b> <b>(DNDN)</b> Provenge, but different at the same time. Provenge and ICT-107 have a near-identical manufacturing process, which includes harvesting monocytes and then maturing those monocytes. However, ICT-107 collects at a much higher purity, can be stored, and can obtain multiple doses with just one blood draw. Then, while Provenge targets one antigen expressed in prostate cancer, ICT-107 <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/739161-immunocellular-therapeutics-explaining-the-benefits-of-a-multiple-antigen-targeting-approach"">targets</a> six that are expressed in GBM. This targeting of antigens is what then allows the immune system to fight the disease.</p> <p>Personally, I think ICT-107 is a game changer in glioblastoma treatment, and I have been anxious to hear of Dr. Singh's next venture. Because, after all, he did take IMUC from being a $5 million OTC stock to a near $200 million company prior to his departure (if you invested $25,000 in IMUC in January 2009 and sold in July 2012, that investment grew to more than half a million dollars!). People were asking what place he might end up next. Well, that &quot;place&quot; has been identified, and after a merger with Genesis Biopharma, Dr. Singh is now the Chairman and CEO of <b>Lion Biotechnologies (GNBPD.OB)</b>.</p> <p>Lion Biotechnologies currently trades at $6.50 a share with a market cap of $100 million. At first, I was highly skeptical of this company, and did not want to invest solely on the notion that Dr. Singh adds shareholder value. However, as I began to take a closer look, and really digest this company, I now believe it too might be something special.</p> <p><b>The Science Behind Singh's New Venture</b></p> <p>The way cancer vaccines work is by stimulating immune system to produce T-cells that actually fight off cancer. There has been a resurgence of interest in T-cells in the last few years with very promising data showing potential cures in leukemia and significant interest from large companies such as <b>Novartis (NVS)</b> and <b>Celgene (CELG)</b> to develop this therapeutic modality. Dr. Singh is making his new bet on a new T-cell technology developed at National Cancer Institute.</p> <p>The technology revolves around Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs), which are found within tumors during their growth, but in very small quantities, giving them very little power to fight large bulky tumors alone. Therefore, Lion is hoping that by taking these TILs, isolating them from tumors, expanding them into billions of T-cells, then re-administering them via IV, these TILs will be able to better fight metastatic solid cancers such as melanoma-- and because they are administered as an IV, the TILS should also kill traces of the disease in other organs. The biggest advantage of TILs is that they target ALL different antigens present on a patient's melanoma, as the treatment is patient specific. So for example, melanoma has over 300 different mutations, and each patient has a different set of mutations. This technology allows production of T-cells for all those different antigens.</p> <p>Now, two thoughts initially came to my mind when I learned of this process: First, the melanoma market is crowded, and second, what is the data? This is where the company's corporate presentation comes into play; and when you begin reading, you see a longer term plan that involves impressive data and the exciting use of anti-CTLA and anti-PD-1 as combination therapies (among other therapies). Moreover, in treating metastatic patients (meaning that traces of the tumor can be found in every organ), I like the idea of an IV. TILs in conjunction with an IV ensure that TILs are administered throughout the body to help cure the disease.</p> <p>However, what I &quot;like&quot; about the company's presentation does not answer questions about competition in the melanoma space, nor does it explain how the approach is transcendent. To explain, one must first understand the nature of current metastatic melanoma treatments.</p> <p><b>Metastatic Melanoma Treatments: Better Drugs, But No Cures</b></p> <p>To start, the typical stage IV metastatic melanoma patients have a median survival of only 6 months on chemotherapy. It is one of the only few diseases with worse prognosis than even glioblastoma. Over the last two years several products have been approved, of which two are most widely used: Zelboraf (BRAF inhibitor) from <b>Roche</b> <b>(RHHBY.OB)</b> and Yervoy (anti-CTLA-4 antibody). For patients who have BRAF mutation, which is about 50% of patients, they are given Zelboraf. Although 50% of these patients respond quickly with tumors disappearing, the <a href=""http://ejcancer-melanoma.com/journal/european-medicines-agency-review-vemurafenib-zelboraf%25C2%25AE-treatment-adult-patients-braf-v600-mu"">response</a> doesn't last long and the disease comes back in 6-9 months. The other 50% patients are given Yervoy, which has an 11% <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462607/"">overall response rate</a> (tumors receding by greater than 50%) and increases median survival by about 3.5 months. In either case, majority of patients recur by 9 months and there are no good treatments available that have demonstrated any survival advantage as second line/salvage therapy.</p> <p>This fact brings us to a very important point in the treatment of cancer, which is the fact that we can delay progression; but there's nothing that's even close to being a cure.</p> <p>In a Phase II study conducted on TILs at National Cancer Institute, 22% of patients (20/93) had a <a href=""http://www.genesis-biopharma.com/?page_id=8"">complete response</a>, which means that all tumors throughout the body were gone! Furthermore, 19 of 20 patients were alive and disease free 6-9 years after treatment according to the most recent company <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/lion-biotechnologies-provides-phase-ii-120000866.html"">press release</a>. Essentially, this means that patients were (dare I say &hellip; again) CURED! Now, none of the FDA approved products for metastatic melanoma even come close in terms of disease free survival. These are patients who are at the salvage stage of their disease, having gone through all other treatments, and have life expectancies of only months. Below, you can see a patient treated with TILs, observing both the severity of the disease and the results of using TILs.</p> <p><em><a href=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/10/1/973391-13806600286153252-Brian-Nichols_origin.jpg"" rel=""lightbox""><img src=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/10/1/973391-13806600286153252-Brian-Nichols.jpg"" hspace=""6"" vspace=""6"" width=""350"" height=""189"" /></a></em><br><em>(Click to enlarge)</em></p> <p>In addition to this very impressive data, TILs <a href=""http://www.genesis-biopharma.com/?page_id=8"">reported</a> an objective response (complete plus partial response) of 50%! In comparison, the highly touted Yervoy (Anti-CTLA-4) has only an 11% response based. To me, this is far more impressive than ICT-107's data, and the reason is because of the variables. In the case of ICT-107, there were only 16 patients and all data was collected at one center. For Lion, data was collected at four different centers and there were a total of 136 patients. Therefore, the data is robust, and it seems that Dr. Singh has once more struck gold.</p> <div class=""big_table""><div class=""zoom_table""> </div> <table border=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""480""> <tr> <td width=""184"" valign=""bottom""> </td> <td width=""171"" valign=""top""><p><b>% Patients Achieving Complete Response</b></p></td> <td width=""177"" valign=""top""><p><b>% Patients Experiencing an Overall Response</b></p> <p><b>(Partial + Complete Response)</b></p></td> <td width=""178"" valign=""bottom""> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width=""184"" valign=""top""><p><b>Autologous TILs ((ACT))</b></p> <p><b>NCI</b></p> <p><b>MD Anderson</b></p> <p><b>H.L.

In retrospect, this data was present before Singh; it simply flew under-the-radar like many products in biotechnology. If Singh was to develop TILs and create hundreds of millions in annual revenue, it would be impressive, but not a shock. Because after all, Questcor Pharmaceuticals did <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/business/questcor-finds-profit-for-acthar-drug-at-28000-a-vial.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"">purchase</a> Acthar Gel for just $100,000 and, in this year alone, has created more than $600 million in sales.</p> <p>For me, I am more interested in next gen TILs, which are mentioned in the company's presentation, but are a focus of Singh. These are TILs that will be combined with other products/therapeutics, such as Zelboraf, Yervoy, and Anti-PD-1s. Essentially, Anti-PD-1s turn off a cloaking device that keeps immune systems from recognizing tumors. Thus, by turning off such mechanisms, while delivering more of an agent to fight the disease, survival can theoretically increase with TILs.</p> <p>Then, as we look further down the line, some believe it is possible to alter TILs genetically, combining TILs with anti-PD-1s without the introduction of new therapeutics. These combination strategies could eliminate need for Anti-PD1 or Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies as TILs could be used as a cargo to carry those signals. But clearly, that's further down the line, and is mere speculation. Currently, the company is developing TILs alone and, in conjunction with other therapies, hoping to replicate early results.</p> <p><b>Final Thoughts</b></p> <p>While it is impossible to know whether or not TILs will be a success in Phase 3 trials, I think Dr. Singh has a good shot to replicate the success experienced at ImmunoCellular Therapeutics. Moreover, with more robust data, and a better-executed Phase 2 study, investors can more accurately assess current data to make a well-informed investment decision.</p> <p>Like I said, management matters in biotechnology, and while having a CEO who concentrates on science is imperative, a company also needs someone with a &quot;Wall Street edge&quot; to add shareholder value. Dr. Singh, who was a scientist before becoming a venture capitalist and CEO, is simply taking technology that was developed by world-renowned researcher/surgeon, <a href=""http://ccr.cancer.gov/staff/staff.asp?profileid=5757"">Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg</a>, who is one of the most cited researchers of our generation, and adding his twist of next generation technologies and rapid development to create shareholder value.</p> <p>Looking at shares of ImmunoCellular both during and after his tenure, the performance speaks for itself. And as of now, with my initial analysis, I think Dr. Singh might just replicate that performance. Now, I am not suggesting that TILs will be a future success, but I do think it has a shot, and what we know now is encouraging. As an investor that seeks deep unknown value in biotechnology, and candidates that have products with big sales potential and the potential for success, I think Lion is interesting, and I am willing to take a small chance on the success of Singh and his new company.</p> <p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[GALE]], [[NBS]], [[QCOR]], [[JAZZ]].

"1327331","2013-04-08 12:16:09","The 9 Levels Of Biotechnology And Who Should Invest: Part 2","<p><a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1324331-the-9-levels-of-healthcare-biotechnology-and-who-should-invest-part-1"">In Part 1</a> we looked at four of the more stable segments of the healthcare space. Hopefully, you now realize the level of diversification that exists in the space, and that one investment alone in the sector may not be enough to fully be diversified. These are companies and segments that all serve different purposes, and in this article I'll focus on five more segments in the space. Now I will explain which companies may be suitable for your consideration and how you might want to invest in each.</p><p><b>Small/Mid-Cap Explosive Growth</b></p><p>If you are looking for an exciting investment in a company that is in the early years of a product launch, then this is your space. The Small/Mid-Cap category typically trades with billion or multi-billion dollar valuations while in late-phase clinical trials, sometimes without a product on the market. These are companies with high expectations that had great support from the start. However, this category of Small/Mid-Cap Explosive Growth is comprised of companies that often fall through the cracks and seemingly come from nowhere. These are companies that often have micro cap valuations during clinical testing and then rally as they defy the odds.</p><p>Some good examples of these kinds of companies are Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Questcor Pharmaceuticals and even Pharmacyclics (PCYC). My favorite, at this time, is <b>Santarus (SNTS),</b> a $1.1 billion company that has risen from being a $75 million company just three years ago. This is a stock that has seen clear gains and is trading with a price/sales ratio of 5.08 and a forward P/E ratio under 15.0. The company grew sales by 60% during its last quarter and is now expecting growth between 50% and 60% growth for this upcoming year. Therefore, despite large gains the stock is still cheap and should have significantly higher upside.</p><p>In my opinion, this particular space is where the greatest upside/safety exists, because most of these are fly under-the-radar companies while in clinical studies, or they had questionable products. In a way, this is the complete opposite of the previous categories discussed (Mega, Big and &quot;Wannabe&quot; Pharmas), which is why these stocks see such large gains as the market adjusts to a product's potential once proven successful. As an investor, to buy one of these stocks you must be willing to endure more volatility and accept a longer-term time horizon. This space is very distorted in value, meaning you can find several undervalued companies with great growth that produce market-leading returns. But beware of the overvalued slowed growth companies that are also present.</p><p><b>Newly Approved</b></p><p>This is, in my opinion, the most dangerous time to buy a biotechnology stock. If you look at recent examples you can see the large losses posted by both <b>Amarin (AMRN)</b> and <b>Arena Pharmaceuticals (ARNA)</b> following drug approvals. The reason is that after a company is awarded an FDA approval its stock typically catapults to reflect the potential of that drug. It's not uncommon for the stock to trade higher in the weeks following an FDA approval. However, as the drug awaits launch by jumping through the regulatory hurdles that exist, the market often begins to reassess and price in any potential downside. Not to mention, a company with a $1 billion or more valuation immediately following an approval has high expectations and investors must realize that drug launches for a company with a newly approved product are usually a slow process.</p><p>These companies do not have the resources of Pfizer, yet investors expect billion-dollar sales quickly. With that being said, I don't think that the Newly Approved stage is a good time to buy a biotechnology stock. I believe there is much greater upside after the product has been launched and is producing growth (category above) or prior to the FDA approval as the market builds a stock in excitement. Therefore, only those who have multi-year hold time outlooks should entertain this space, and even then it would probably be wise to seek better value.</p><p><b>The Expected Approval</b></p><p>It's not hard to find companies in this space, as they are usually among the year's best performing stocks. And if timed correctly, there can be a great amount of upside present. One of my favorite candidates is <b>ACADIA Pharmaceuticals (ACAD)</b>, and it has risen from an $80 million company to a market cap greater than $600 million with the <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/market_currents/post/901741"">successful trial</a> of pimavanserin. ACADIA is special because it had low expectations prior to data in November of 2012, and despite immediate gains greater than 100% following successful data, the stock was still cheap thanks to years of low expectations. In 2013 the stock has rallied 70% and has become one of the market's favorite momentum stocks.</p><p>The key with stocks in this space is value. These are stocks that move fast - and if you are interested in the space you must find a level at which you believe the stock is undervalued and overvalued. A stock in this space will often trade beyond the overvalued level. But then after an FDA approval it sees the &quot;Amarin effect,&quot; which is profit taking as sales potential and valuation realign. My formula for finding value in this space is one times peak sales potential. If I find a stock that trades below this level then I consider it a &quot;Buy.&quot;</p><p>The reason for this calculation is because biotech stocks often trade at four-six times sales during the marketing process, meaning upside would still exist at one times peak sales potential. On a side note, investors should realize that as these levels in biotechnology decline, more risk is being presented. In this category we expect an approval, but there is always a chance that the FDA will deny a drug due to more data being needed, a manufacturing issue, or a problem with safety. Thus, investors must keep this in perspective and realize that, not only do you have to account for value, but also all potential FDA responses to a drug when making an investment in this space.</p><p><b>Late-Stage Clinical</b></p><p>Sometimes the market misses clear value, and if you can identify it, then this can be a very rewarding space. The companies in this category are ones that are near an announcement of late-stage data. This is also a space that can range in valuation from $100 million to $2 billion. Typically, larger valuations are rewarded to companies that have higher expectations. But every now and then the market misses one of these opportunities and it creates unprecedented gains, such was the case with ACADIA Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Within this space you can really see the domino effect in biotechnology for the first time. It's when a company such as ACADIA Pharmaceuticals begins as a small and speculative stock, and then grows into an expected approval stock and then ultimately into a growth stock. One of my favorites in this segment is ImmunoCellular Therapeutics (IMUC).</p><p>ImmunoCellular Therapeutics is a $125 million company, but with its current trial, it could very quickly be transformed into a billion dollar company. To better understand, consider Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT): In its Phase 2 trial it produced incredible results with its drug eteplirsen, treated on just 12 patients (8 received drug and 4 on placebo). With strong Phase 2 results it became a billion dollar company, and is now expected to earn an accelerated approval (making it a late-stage company).</p><p>ImmunoCellular Therapeutics' drug ICT-107 is treating one of the most deadly forms of cancer in existence, glioblastoma <span>multiforme ((</span>GBM)), one in which patients live just over one year following diagnosis and must surpass three lesser degrees of glioblastoma before being diagnosed as having GBM. In a 16 patient trial, patients lived on average 23.8 months longer than historical standard of care (SOC) and eight of 16 lived more than four years. <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/810301-ict-107-into-perspective-part-1"">These results</a> are unprecedented, and if ImmunoCellular can produce any level of benefit in its Phase 2 trial then it will receive an <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/731511-new-legislation-speeds-up-fda-approval-process-for-immunocellular-therapeutics-and-other-innovating-therapies"">accelerated approval</a> because of the disease's severity.</p><p>Typically, an investor would seek a Phase 3 product for late-stage clinical investments. However, the goal of this category is to find investments in biotechnology that are near FDA decisions and are unrealized by the market. With ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, and data due at the end of this year, an FDA decision will most likely be within the next 16 months. With all these positives in consideration, investors must realize that these are companies with upside tied to clinical development - and anything can happen in large trial settings. I think ImmunoCellular looks very attractive, but investors should only buy if they can withstand excessive volatility, strong opinions, and only to compliment a biotechnology portfolio, as no stock in this space should be the center of your portfolio.</p><p><b>Micro-Cap Speculative</b></p><p>In this final segment of biotechnology, you can see where the retirement-like upside is first created. However, finding one is like finding a needle in a haystack ... it is not easy. The problem that retail investors make is with large positions in such stocks, when what you need is good research in locating possible &quot;needles&quot; combined with a very small investment that you can afford to lose, whether it be $1,000 or $5,000. This is a space where retail investors often chase dreams, hoping to cash in on the next Pharmacyclics as a $50 million company. But unfortunately, most of the companies in this space never materialize, and present the greatest level of risk to the investor.</p><p>While most never materialize, some do, and it's stories such as <b>Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ)</b> that keep investors seeking the next big one. In just four years the stock has increased more than 6,000%. At one time the company was valued at just $35 million, but is now valued at $3.2 billion, meaning a very small $3,000 investment could've been worth almost $300,000, and its gain such as this that attract people to the space. Every year, I choose one-two stocks to buy, with small investments, and in 2013 I bought <b>OncoSec Medical (ONCS.OB).</b></p><p>I know that the company is really small and extremely speculative, but I really like its OMS Technology. My interest began after <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1243661-a-comprehensive-look-at-immunotherapy-part-2"">interviewing an analyst</a> whose experience in the space led me to research the company. I find its usage of IL-12 to be very encouraging (due to the effectiveness of the agent) and I think its technology of using electricity to create pores (electroporation) and direct treatment to a tumor could be highly effective, and has also produced great results. This is a platform that has great revenue potential in a number of indications - and with a number of catalysts upcoming, it is very possible that its rally could begin in the coming weeks.</p><p>For every Jazz Pharmaceuticals, there are 100 that do not succeed. In the process of identifying such a company an investor must seek stocks that are unrealized, have large market potential if its product is successful, have a late-stage product with previous data, and it needs catalysts among other areas of research. Not to mention, you have to realize that these are the highest of risks within the space and that sometimes you will be wrong with your investment. Therefore, understand that this space has by far the greatest upside, but should be explored with caution.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>Hopefully, you found this series useful and that now you have an idea of how you can use the information to invest in this industry. If you are still having trouble, then try to use the following as a rule: Companies at the very top of the list (Part 1) have the least amount of risk and the smallest upside in performance; those at the bottom (Part 2) have the best upside, but the most amount of risk. In addition, you may want to determine the size of the investment based on the category, as an investment in Big Pharma should be much larger than an investment in Late-Stage Clinical. I encourage readers to take the information, use it as a guide, and then explore the industry in search of the best value. Good luck!</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[JAZZ]], [[SNTS]], [[ONCS.OB]], [[IMUC]]. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

"1643792","2013-08-19 09:49:57","Coca-Cola's Gamble On Coke Life May Have Other Bottlers Scrambling For A Better Tasting Stevia","<p>Earlier this year <strong>Coca-Cola (KO)</strong> <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/28/coca-cola-life_n_3516512.html"">launched Coke Life</a>, a new naturally sweetened low calorie cola that comes in environmentally friendly bottles and cans, in Argentina. <a href=""http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Manufacturers/Coca-Cola-ups-the-ante-in-mid-calorie-cola-stakes-with-stevia-sweetened-Coca-Cola-Life"">Boasting only 64 calories</a> for a 12 oz serving and 50% less sugar than a regular bottle of Coke, this new product, wrapped in a green label as opposed to the famous red label, is sweetened with a blend of sugar and stevia, the sweet extract from a South American shrub that has been the darling of the natural zero calorie sugar substitute market. Though stevia is growing in popularity, so much so that the World Health Organization predicts the extract will eventually replace 20-30% of all dietary sweeteners, the natural sweetener is still in its early stages and there are a number of flavor profiles that need to be worked out to compete with other methods of sweetening beverages. However, the soda industry does not have the luxury of waiting too much longer to bring a new natural low calorie sweetener to market as soda sales have been steadily dropping since 1998.</p><p><strong>Consumers Are Choosing Healthier Products</strong></p><p>The soda industry needs to address some major challenges if it wants to stem the decline in sales, which seems to be accelerating each year. In 2010 <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/25/usa-soda-beverage-digest-idUSWEN0088Z20130325"">soda sales declined</a> 0.5%, in 2011 the decline was 1%, and in 2012 the downward trend continued to 1.2%. The decline can be attributed to a larger pool of sweet beverage choices such as energy drinks, iced teas, and flavor infused waters; but more importantly, there is a changing trend to more health conscious consumers who are looking to trim the amount of sugar and artificial ingredients in products they consume. Just as quick service restaurants like <strong>McDonalds (MCD)</strong> and <strong>KFC (YUM)</strong> have felt the pressure from fast casual restaurants, like <strong>Chipotle (CMG)</strong> and <strong>Panera Bread Co. (PNRA)</strong>, which serve healthier and more environmentally friendly products, the soda industry too is feeling the pressure from these same consumers who are demanding a more healthy and natural choice. While soda sales in the U.S. is still big business (2012 sales were $28.70 billion), Coca-Cola saw its soda sales drop 4% in the U.S. in the <a href=""http://www.vendingtimes.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=754303A430C54C2AA236B18E2C06AB17&amp;nm=Vending+Features&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3a%3aArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=DB6FB9F4D87645F29C9E8F5CFC3BCC2A"">second quarter</a> 2013, while <strong>PepsiCo (PEP)</strong> <a href=""http://www.dailyfinance.com/2009/07/22/pepsicos-earnings-drop-guess-whos-winning-the-cola-wars/"">sales dropped 3%.</a></p><p><strong>DIET SODA SALES LEAD IN SODA SALES DECLINE</strong></p><p>With the war on sugary beverages and the changing attitude of the consumer to lower sugar intake, one would think that diet soda sales would be on the rise. Not so, sales of <a href=""http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/07/americans-are-cutting-back-regular-and-diet-sodas/67599/"">diet sodas are down</a> at a greater percentage than the sugary sodas, as consumers are also becoming more conscious about what chemicals they put in their bodies, so much so that Cocoa Cola is rolling out a <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Health/diet-coke-ad-defends-artificial-sweeteners/story?id=19958794"">national campaign</a> assuring customers that artificial sweeteners are safe to consume. Pepsi's diet soda sales saw a decrease of 8% compared to the 5% drop in regular sodas, and Coca-Cola as well saw similar declines. According to <a href=""http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2013/07/coke_pepsi_second_quarter.html"">John Sicher</a>, editor and publisher of the trade publication, Beverage Digest, the drop in sales &quot;won't change and will probably get worse without a major breakthrough in new sweeteners.&quot; And that, I believe, is why Coke launched its new line Coca-Cola Life.</p><p><img src=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/8/4314621_13768754378502_rId14.jpg"" /></p><p>But why would Coca-Cola take the risk to roll out a stevia cola product to a nation of 41 million (Argentina) where it already controls <a href=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-06-26/business/chi-midcalorie-coke-20130626_1_stevia-no-calorie-coca-cola-zero"">50% of the soda market</a>? Especially when CEO, <a href=""http://www.brandchannel.com/home/post/2013/05/30/Nooyi-Pepsi-Remarks-053013.aspx"">Indra Nooyi,</a> of Coke's major rival, Pepsi, commented negatively on the flavor profile of stevia in colas when she said, &quot;Stevia, unfortunately, does not work well in colas.&quot; I believe the answer can be found in Coca-Cola's partnership with Cargill, the privately held food producer and marketer, and what appears to be a breakthrough method in producing stevia, which may just give them an advantage over other bottlers with their stevia brand, Truvia.</p><p>Up until now stevia has been grown on small farms scattered across the globe, though mostly in China. The leaves are then sold to providers like <strong>PureCircle (PCRTF.PK)</strong>, the largest of the stevia distributors. These providers would then extract the sweet glycoside, Rebaudioside A (Reb A), and ship it off to their customers. PureCircle has deals in place with Coca-Cola and Pepsi to supply both companies with stevia, and has been working with their contract growers to develop new strains of stevia that will have better flavor profiles. So far these new developments and have seen moderate success, but have yet to find the &quot;sweet spot&quot; for colas. Recently two other glycosides -- <a href=""http://www.beveragedaily.com/Ingredients/Relight-my-Cola-Fire-FDA-approves-PureCircle-Reb-D-stevia"">Reb D and Reb X</a> -- have gained attention by both PureCircle and its customers as having better flavor profiles for soda than Reb A. The problem is that both Reb D and Reb X are found in minute amounts in the stevia leaves; thus it will take a lot more leaf production, which will make the extract far more costly than Reb A.</p><p><strong>FERMENTATION PROCESSES COULD BE THE FUTURE OF STEVIA PRODUCTION</strong></p><p>At this time PureCircle is supplying the lion share of stevia to both Coca-Cola and Pepsi, but that all might change now that Cargill agreed to invest with the Swiss company <strong>Evolva Holding SA (EVE.SWX),</strong> to <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/evolva-cargill-deal-co-develop-060000415.html"">develop</a> its yeast fermentation-derived steviol glycosides. <a href=""http://www.evolva.com/about-us"">Evolva</a>, which has had success providing technologies to develop ingredients to the food and beverage industry as well as the consumer health and pharmaceutical sectors, has already succeeded in creating stevia extracts via its fermentation-based process by using low-cost sustainable carbohydrate feedstock as starting material. A successful fermentation-based process on an industrial scale would be a &quot;game changer&quot; in extracting stevia as it would allow for the production of the individual components of stevia to be developed, regardless of how minute (like Reb D and Reb X), which in turn could result in a number of new blends and flavor profiles in any volume required. It also opens up the possibility for food and beverage manufacturers to fine-tune the stevia extract that best fits the products, including colas.</p><p>Evolva has been developing its stevia fermentation process on a pilot-scale at its Copenhagen site and expects <a href=""http://www.evolva.com/products/stevia"">production by 2015</a>. And since steviol glycosides have been approved for use in foods and beverages in the U.S. and Europe, Cargill will only have to prove substantial equivalence to use the process for Truvia.</p><p>It would make perfect sense that Coca-Cola introduced Coke Life in Argentina as the foundation for a marketing strategy with the expectation of the actual production of the fermentation-based method to begin in the next few years. <a href=""http://www.steviafirst.com/industry_news/news_article/2013/07/the-next-engine-of-growth-for-the-stevia-industry"">Robert Brooke</a>, CEO of <strong>Stevia First (STVF.OB)</strong>, a development-stage agricultural biotechnology company that is in the process of testing and developing its own stevia fermentation- based process under a license agreement with Canada's <a href=""http://www.steviafirst.com/news/news_releases/2012/08/stevia-first-corp.-licenses-fermentation-based-stevia-intellectual-property-from-vineland-research-and-innovation-centre"">Vineland Research and Innovation Center</a>, sees the rollout of Coke Life as validation of the potential of the fermentation-based process for both Evolva and his company. &quot;The added wrinkle is that it (Coke Life) was also disclosed, in almost the same breath, that Coca-Cola is pursuing next-generation stevia sweeteners like Reb D and Reb X. These next-generation sweeteners are very rare in nature and therefore more costly to produce, making them ideal candidates for production using fermentation processes.&quot;</p><p><strong>FERMENTATION-BASED STEVIA: BETTER PRODUCT, LOWER COSTS</strong></p><p>According to separate press releases from the aforementioned companies, the fermentation process has worked on a pilot scale for both Cargill and Evolva and for Stevia First, validating the potential of an entirely new method of producing a superior stevia product that can be manufactured anywhere on the globe. But there is another advantage to the fermentation-based process: It costs a lot less than the farm-based method. Stevia First's <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/883621-interview-with-stevia-first-ceo-robert-brooke"">Mr. Brooke commented</a> about the potential savings in extracting stevia via the fermentation-based process: &quot; This (the fermentation-based process) has the potential to bypass or diminish the need for stevia leaf production, which currently accounts for 70% or more the costs (sic) involved with stevia extract production, while also producing a final product that could be better-tasting and more consistent.&quot;</p><p><strong>OTHER SODA BOTTLERS WILL NEED TO DEVELOP A COLA TO COMPETE WITH COKE LIFE</strong></p><p>If Coca-Cola were successful in developing the first stevia-based cola with a superior taste profile and doing so at a lower cost than other bottlers, Coca-Cola would have an incredible advantage over its competitors in both taste and cost. And I doubt that Pepsi would want to be forced to buy its stevia from Cargill who is partnered with Coca-Cola, especially since it already has a competing stevia product in PureVia, owned jointly with Merisant. Therefore I wouldn't be surprised that, in order to compete in the low calorie or zero calorie natural sweetener sugar substitute market, either Pepsi or PureCircle or one of the other major bottlers looks to develop its own fermentation process or partners with another company who is developing such a method, like the California-based Stevia First.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p><p>PureCircle has had a great run, up 71% year-over-year. However, the stock has pulled back slightly in the past month of trading. Though I don't credit the pullback with the Coke Life announcement, I do have concerns for the future profits of PureCircle if it just sits back and watches Cargill and Evolva's fermentation-based process move to an industrial scale, which may put little Stevia First, with its own process, in play with a PureCircle or a major bottler.</p><p>Coca-Cola, whose stock closed on Monday August 13th at $39.65, down $0.81, has dropped over 6% in the past three months. Revenue came in at $12.75 billion, below estimates of $12.95 billion. But over the long term there are few stocks that are better to have in one's portfolio for safety, growth, and dividend returns. Add to that, if the company does indeed succeed with Coke Life in rekindling the diet cola market, look for the product to line the shelves of countries around the world, which would enhance the company's already solid bottom line. I see Coco-Cola as a buy, especially with the current dip in the price, which I doubt will last long.</p><p>PepsiCo stock closed on Monday August 13th at $83.39, down $0.42. The stock has had an excellent run up year-to-date, almost 22%. However, there is no hiding that while snack sales were up 6%, soda sales slid 1%. I do like the stock, but I'd like it better if the company announced a product that would compete with Coke Life. But until that happens I'd wait for a pull back on price before buying.</p><p>What I find interesting, as an investor, is that Coca-Cola's stock did not rise after its late June announcement that it planned to sell the mid-calorie cola in Argentina, but Evolva's stock has since risen over 15%. This tells me that if Pepsi or PureCircle does invest in a fermentation-based process, either by collaboration or an outright buy of a smaller company, look for that smaller company's stock to rise.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

"1067891","2012-12-17 08:23:26","3 Small Pharma Companies With Major Catalysts In 2013","<p><strong>Small Market Cap Pharma Attempting to Address Undermet Needs</strong></p><p>As 2012 wanes, investors may look back on the year and see that it was filled with landmark headlines indicating huge gains or losses for investors in promising healthcare companies attempting to address areas of unmet medical needs. There was much money to be made and lost through investments in these companies striving to navigate the clinical and regulatory pathways in efforts to ultimately reach their goals - addressing unmet or undermet needs and financially benefiting from those successes. In order to stay ahead of the curve, wise investors may choose to open positions in small pharmaceuticals with significant catalysts ahead in 2013. These catalysts may be in the form of attempting to gain regulatory approvals or navigating <span>Phase II or <span>Phase III clinicals in order to advance company pipelines. I wish to delve into some promising small pharmaceuticals for the year ahead of us. In order to address the different types of investors with differing risk tolerances, I am presenting companies from small market capitalization development-phase companies to those with larger valuations and likely on the cusp of transitioning into a marketing-phase pharmaceutical. This article should be construed as the beginning of the research venture into each of these, and interested investors are advised to perform their own due diligence before opening positions in any of these possibilities.</p><p><strong>AcelRx Pharmaceuticals (ACRX)</strong> has had a great 2012 and looks primed to have another great year ahead. The company recently released clinical data from the first of three <span>Phase III trials that wrapped up in Q4 for its lead product candidate, ARX-01. The drug utilizes AcelRX's sublingual (under the tongue and absorbed through the skin) administration tablet technology termed the NanoTab&reg; System. The active ingredient in ARX-01 is sufentanil, a potent opioid analgesic that is typically administered intravenously. The problem with the IV administration of sufentanil is that there is an initial spike in the drug's concentration in the patient's blood plasma with the subsequent concentration waning rapidly with decreased efficacy after the initial onset.</p><p>The first of the expected three data sets was released on <a href=""http://news.acelrx.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=241441%26p=irol-acelrxnewsArticle%26ID=1759078%26highlight="">November 15th</a> with convincing results. Subjects that had just undergone major abdominal or orthopedic surgeries were administered ARX-01 for the trial with a control group receiving IV-administered morphine. According to the press release, ARX-01 was statistically superior to IV PCA morphine for the PGA (patient global assessment) endpoint (p=0.009). The number of patients rating NanoTab&reg; System as &quot;Excellent&quot; was higher than those rating IV PCA morphine as excellent (42.9% vs. 30.6%, p=0.016). Additionally, patients in the study reported that they had greater overall satisfaction (4.15 vs. 3.83 out of 5, p=0.003) with greater overall ease of care (4.45 vs. 4.07, p&lt;0.001) with the NanoTab&reg; System compared to IV PCA morphine. Also noted in the press release, but not touted (though I think it is very pertinent), was the statement that &quot;Similar percentages of NanoTab&reg; System-treated and IV PCA morphine-treated patients dropped out of the study prematurely due to lack of efficacy (7.3% vs. 8.3% respectively) or due to an adverse event (7.9% vs. 11.1% respectively).&quot; Although ARX-01 narrowly beat out IV PCA morphine for dropping out due to lack of efficacy, the 3.2% greater portion of the overall patient set dropping out due to adverse events appears to be very significant.</p><p>Shares in the company spiked and stayed strong until a December 5th 10 million share offering (pricing at the time was not noted) killed the stock's momentum and triggered a two-day sell-off. It is <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1051061-favorable-acelrx-stock-offering-price-may-catalyze-the-company-s-share-price"">my opinion</a> that investors were concerned about the potential share price of the offering. An after-hours announcement by the company on December 6th noted that the offering would be priced at the closing market price of $3.31. Shares responded with a huge volume of trading on December 7th, closing up on the day 3.93% at 3.44 after trading as high as 12% at $3.71.</p><p>AcelRx investors should be anticipating an exciting 2013 ahead. Q1 will likely witness data release of its other two <span>Phase III trials for ARX-01 with a subsequent new drug application ((NDA)) sometime in mid year. If all goes as planned, the company should receive a regulatory decision from the FDA in 2H, providing a full year of major catalysts for the company in 2013. Another catalyst that will likely be impactful first will be a regulatory decision by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 1H for ARX-01. An <a href=""http://news.acelrx.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=241441%26p=RssLanding%26cat=news%26id=1741054"">October 3rd, 2012 announcement</a> by the company noted that the three <span>Phase III trials' data would be sufficient to meet EMA requirements for regulatory approval if the data were positive. The trials would be helping AcelRx get the most &quot;bang for its buck&quot; as additional positive data from the remaining trials could mean not only an FDA approval in the U.S., but also a marketing approval for the 31 EU/EFTA (European Union/European Free Trade Association) countries representing a population of over 500 million people.</p><p>AcelRx shares are still well under the 52-week high of $5.25 reached on November 27 after the first of the three <span>Phase III trials' data were released. However, the stock is now steadily rebounding since its recent selloff due to the stock offering announcement. I anticipate a slow but steady run up with some dips likely by the end of the year. If the remaining two <span>Phase III trials' data are as positive as the first set already presented, then affirmative FDA and EMA decisions are likely, barring any unforeseen problems. Failure on either or both of the two remaining data sets could be problematic for the company with share price suffering. However, the two remaining trials are for differing indications: patients undergoing elective unilateral knee replacement surgery and a functionality study of the handheld component of ARX-01 in unilateral knee replacement surgery. These are likely smaller targeted patient groups and would probably simply be left out of the NDA and product labeling if the remaining two <span>Phase III data sets are not as promising. AcelRx is a development-phase company and is not an investment for all investor types. Additional due diligence is advised before opening a position in this company's common shares. For the short term, there appears to be support at the $3.31 range with a possible &quot;double bottom&quot; formation developing which could be a bullish indicator.</p><p><strong>Advanced Medical Isotope Corp. (ADMD.OB)</strong>, also referred to as AMIC, is a budding development-phase company that has witnessed its common shares advance by more than 180% YTD. The company has been developing its capabilities to produce radioisotopes to be used for diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy for the last couple of years, but now appears to be advancing a bit more rapidly. On <a href=""http://markets.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/news/read/21121432/advanced_medical_isotope_corporation_adds_regional_customer"">April 12th</a> of this year, AMIC announced its first contract in which it would supply medical isotopes for Kennewick General Hospital of Kennewick, Washington. Although not mentioned in the press release, the utilized isotope is fluorine-18 (F-18), the isotope most widely used for PET (positron emission tomography), a commonly used diagnostic tool used to produce high-quality, 3D images in evaluating cancers, cardiac disease, and brain function. Although details of the contract were not revealed, the company's recent <a href=""http://filings.issuerdirect.com/viewer/index/1449349/000119983512000741/"">Q3 filing</a> indicated revenue for the period, most likely the result of this contract. For the three months ending September 30th, the company reported revenue of $62K, with $181K for the nine month period. This is still construed as a development-phase company, as its $13 million market capitalization reflects. However, real revenue for a small company like this with a real product is significant and could lead to bigger contracts in the coming days and months as it continues to grow its network of contacts.</p><p>AMIC's potential is two-fold. Its initial business model and only source of revenue is medical isotope production. Early in the development of its business, the company already has a network of universities (SUNY Buffalo, Idaho State University, and University of Missouri) and three U.S. national laboratories (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) enlisted in its early work in isotope production and pertinent application research. The company's <a href=""http://www.isotopeworld.com/investor-relations/growth-strategy/"">growth strategies</a> as noted on its website, give investors food for thought in the terms of many possible upcoming press releases. For example, consider the following statements:</p><ul><li>AMIC began formal negotiations for the creation of strategic relationships to produce and sell medical isotopes in Taiwan and China.</li><li>Initiated discussions for the construction of regional PET isotope production centers in Los Angeles, California and Oahu, Hawaii.</li><li>AMIC commenced three international advanced technology collaborative development projects for production and isotopic separation capability, offering high-value products not available from other sources.</li><li>Completed a strategic acquisition of a competitive firm, thereby establishing AMIC's position as a marketplace supplier through international sales of the O-18 isotope.</li></ul><p>Updates on any of these with possibilities of contracts or revenue coming could provide for significant share price movement. In the company's <a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/e/120814/admd10-q.html"">Q2 financials</a> was another obscure statement providing for evidence of possible news in future. In the filing, the company noted &quot;We currently offer regional distribution of F-18 from our Kennewick, WA production facility. <em>Other regional production facilities are being considered throughout the U.S. and abroad</em>.&quot;</p><p>Possible catalysts loom large for this microcap company due to potential contracts and news of developments pertaining to its increasing capacity to produce medical isotopes through its linear accelerator technologies rather than the industry's normal source of nuclear reactors. However, an announcement from <a href=""http://www.isotopeworld.com/investor-relations/news/17/"">April 12th</a> of this year dramatically increased shareholder interest in the company and diversified its business model by adding a clinical-stage therapy candidate to its product line. The company announced that it had obtained an exclusive license to eight patents for injectable radiogel technology for use in high-dose radiation therapy from Battelle, the world's largest nonprofit research and development company. Radiogel is comprised of a water-based biodegradable polymer that contains the medical isotope, yttrium-90 (Y-90). The product is injected into targeted cancer tumors where it then polymerizes into a lattice (cage-like structure) that is immobile and traps the Y-90 microspheres. The Y-90 emits high-energy beta radiation which is therapeutic by killing local cancer cells that are more susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of radiation than normal, healthy cells. This offers the same therapeutic effects as externally-administered radiation treatments with a focus on only cancer tumors while having minimal systemic exposure to the harmful side effects. <a href=""http://radiographics.rsna.org/content/25/suppl_1/S41.full"">Y-90</a> has a short life as indicated by its 64.2 hour half life. In 64.2 hours after administration, half of the material has decayed to the stable zirconium-90. In another 64.2 hours later, half of the remaining has decayed and so forth. By the 11th day after administration, over 94% of the radiation has been emitted, leaving little to negatively affect the safety profile of the treatment regimen. The remaining polymer lattice degrades and is absorbed by and excreted by the body.</p><p>Although the company hasn't recently released an update on the radiogel product, an <a href=""http://www.isotopeworld.com/investor-relations/powerpoint-presentation/"">April 2012 company presentation</a> by the company CEO, James Katzaroff, gives investors an idea of what could be coming. On slide number eight, the company noted &quot;Animal studies and testing for FDA 510(K) approval about to begin. Approval is projected in 2013.&quot; Not a company given to excessive press releases or updates, an update on the initiation (or completion) of these trials or a 510(K) (medical device application for marketing approval) application could be a huge share price mover for this company's common shares.</p><p>Advanced Medical Isotope Corp. is not an investment for every investor type. The company should be considered as a development-phase company with minimal revenue currently. It is traded on the OTCBB exchange which is more subject to share price manipulation and illiquidity at times. Interested investors are advised to perform considerable research into the company, its medical isotopes product and research work, its radiogel technology now being developed and then any SEC filings from the last couple of years before opening a position in the company's common shares. There is risk here, but the $13 million market capitalization appears to take that into consideration. The upside here could be significant depending on how the company's business model unfolds. Shareholders could witness an exciting 2013 ahead for this promising and increasingly-diverse company.</p><p><strong>Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (LXRX)</strong> common shares have had a volatile year with a 52-week range of $0.94-$3.28. The company's <a href=""http://www.lexpharma.com/pipeline/"">developing pipeline</a> is headed by its lead drug candidate, Telotristat etiprate (LX1032), an orally-administered drug that acts by inhibiting the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase ((TPH)), the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for serotonin production. The company recently released <a href=""http://www.lexpharma.com/news/press-releases/2242-second-phase-2-trial-of-telotristat-etiprate-shows-positive-results-in-carcinoid-syndrome.html""><span>Phase II data</a> for the drug for use in patients suffering from carcinoid syndrome, which is manifested by a combination of symptoms, including diarrhea, bronchial restriction, facial flushing, and increased heart rate, all caused by the release of excessive serotonin and other substances into the blood stream from metastatic carcinoid tumors. Data released from the trial were promising with significant improvement seen in symptoms across the board. The number of daily bowel movements had a median reduction of 46.4% from baseline at week 12 with a statistical significance of (P=0.001). 75% of patients at week 12 reported an improvement in their overall carcinoid symptoms. Statistically significant improvements in stool consistency (p &lt; 0.001) and trends of reductions in abdominal pain (p=0.09) and the number of cutaneous flushing episodes (p=0.052) were also noted. The median percentage reductions from baseline of urinary 5-HIAA (biomarker of serotonin synthesis) at weeks 8 and 12 were 68.3% (p=0.019) and 72.7% (p=0.031), respectively.</p><p>On <a href=""http://www.lexpharma.com/news/press-releases/2243-lexicon-initiates-phase-3-clinical-trial-of-telotristat-etiprate-in-patients-with-carcinoid-syndrom.html"">October 12th</a> Lexicon announced that it had initiated enrollment for its <span>Phase III clinical evaluating LX1032 for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome. The registrational trial is a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug as a new treatment for carcinoid syndrome that is refractory to a currently approved therapy. The 105-patient trial will then enter its final phase with each of the groups of subjects receiving the maximum dose, 500mg, three times per day for the remaining 36-week period. Depending on the enrollment rate, this should put topline results as being released in late 2013 with interim results likely throughout the year.</p><p>Tackling a fairly small indication, but with an unmet clinical need, Lexicon obtained Fast Track status and Orphan Drug designation from the FDA, and Orphan Drug designation from the European Medicines Agency for LX1032 to treat carcinoid syndrome. Lexicon is attempting to address a smaller area of need for this therapy than AMIC's radiogel for solid cancer tumors or AcelRX's ARX-01 for knee surgery and general abdominal or orthopedic surgeries. However, the Orphan Drug status for the therapy provides for competition-free marketing for LX1032 for up to seven years after regulatory approval to better enable the company to profit from its candidate's success. Despite also being a development-phase company, Lexicon's market capitalization is more substantial than the remaining two candidates at almost $960 million. However, the company does have a more <a href=""http://www.lexpharma.com/pipeline/"">impressive pipeline</a> that is more diverse and tackling more indications than either AcelRx or AMIC. Each of these three companies has upside potential if events unfold positively for 2013. Interested investors should perform much research into each of these to more fully understand the potential for clinical and regulatory success as well as the targeted indication sizes. With 2012 waning, now could be the time to open a position(s) in anticipation of a possible exciting year ahead for these promising development-phase companies.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[ACRX]], [[ADMD.OB]].

"1220731","2013-02-25 09:50:56","5 Speculative Biotech Stocks With Catalysts Pending","<p>In this article, I will spotlight five companies with data announcements in the coming weeks/months. These are all small-cap biotechnology companies that are relying highly on these upcoming data announcements to maintain current valuations, or to breakout into new levels. These announcements will all create movement, but the question is in which direction?</p><p><b>NewLink Genetics Corp. (NLNK)</b> is involved with the discovery, development, and commercialization of immunotherapeutic products to improve cancer treatment options. The company has a diversified pipeline with its <a href=""http://www.linkp.com/programs/hyperacute-immunotherapies.html"">HyperAcute</a> immunotherapies for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, and breast cancer. The company uses genetically modified human cancer cells to create a natural immune response, and will be closely watched in 2013.</p><p>In early studies, NewLink's HyperAcute platform has been successful, and it currently has three ongoing late-stage studies: Pancreatic (Phase 3), non-small cell carcinoma (Phase 1/2), and melanoma (Phase 2). Last year, data from its <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/NLNK.O/key-developments/article/2551571"">melanoma study</a> showed that the vaccine created a <a href=""http://www.rttnews.com/1899422/newlink-genetics-reveals-positive-results-from-its-phase-2-immunotherapy-trial.aspx?type=qf%26utm_source=google%26utm_campaign=sitemap"">median overall survival</a> of 29 months and produced an overall survival of 42% at three years in the pancreatic cancer study. Now the company is preparing to <a href=""http://www.fiercevaccines.com/story/newlink-genetics-takes-stage-asco/2012-06-07"">announce interim Phase 3 randomized data</a> for its pancreatic treatment sometime in the next month. The final data will not be available until next year; however, the upside for this one product makes <span>it a very impor</span>tant data set for investors.</p><p>Assuming that NewLink's data for pancreatic cancer is positive and it goes on to earn regulatory approval, analysts project peak sales of more than $800 million worldwide. If the interim results are positive for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, then investors may assume that the platform will be effective in treating other cancers. It can be inferred that this data could add a great amount of value to this company. The stock is currently trading at $12.09 with a company market cap of $309 million. If interim data are positive, watch for a quick 30-40% move higher, and then watch for additional gains during the following year as investors await final data release.</p><p><b>OncoSec Medical (ONCS.OB)</b> is another small biotech company, one that has developed a platform called the OncoSec Medical System (OMS), utilizing the company's proprietary electroporation technology. OMS uses quick bursts of electricity to increase the uptake of whatever agent is injected, which allows more of the agent to be delivered effectively into the tumor(s). The company uses this approach for both immunotherapy (ImmunoPulse) and chemotherapy (NeoPulse) agents.</p><p>In early studies, the company's OMS has been highly effective. The company is currently testing its ImmunoPulse platform on three different cancers: melanoma, Merkel cell carci<span>noma ((MCC)),</span> and cutaneous T cell lymphoma. In these studies <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-technologies/"">it was found</a> that just 1/20 of the traditional dose was needed, as the uptake of the agents used was increased by 4,000 fold. Resultantly, patients experienced fewer side effects and tumors were destroyed more effectively because the entire agent was reaching the targeted tumor (due to the electrical pulses creating temporary pores in the cancer <span>cells' w</span>alls). The company has also found that OMS, through the ImmunoPulse treatment, not only treats targeted tumors, but also indirectly affected distant tumors. The interim results from ImmunoPulse show that OMS had a <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1049441-oncosec-medical-2013-will-be-a-year-of-crucial-events"">significantly greater local and distant response</a> compared to the promising therapies Allovectin-7 and OncoVex, giving it a higher probability of success.</p><p>OncoSec is a small company that has traded almost flat over the last year, with periods of large gains prior to data announcements. Most recently, the stock more than doubled in just one month when interim data for MCC and metastatic melanoma were announced last year. This year, the company has more important data announcements, on all three of its Phase 2 trials. The most important is for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, which is its largest indication, and the company is expected to be presenting data at this year's ASCO in late May and early June. Seeing as how this stock rallies in anticipation, but then falls during the dead periods between data, we might very well see consistent gains as the company has a data-packed year of enrolling patients, presenting data, and then starting new studies.</p><p><b>Raptor Pharmaceuticals (RPTP)</b> is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapies to counteract neurodegenerative disorders. The company's lead product is Procysbi, which is a delayed release cysteamine bitartrate oral therapy for <a href=""http://www.raptorpharma.com/RP103_cystinosis.html"">nephropathic cystinosis</a>. The disease affects just 2,000 patients worldwide, with about 500 of those in the U.S. Consequently, this is not a high revenue-producing product, as <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/746071-jmp-securities-sees-80-chance-of-fda-approval-for-raptor-s-rp103"">analysts project peak global sales</a> around $100 million.</p><p>Raptor Pharmaceuticals has lost more than 35% of its value over the last year, and currently has a market capitalization of $262 million. The company has no approved drugs, but is probably close to an approval with Procysbi. The Orphan Drug is also being tested in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial to treat Huntington's disease, meaning there is potential beyond the one indication. Investors are now waiting for an FDA decision (4/30) on the approval status of Procysbi. The decision on this drug was <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/5158901-raptor-pharmaceutical-corp-provides-update-on-procysbi-tm-nda-review"">extended back</a> in December, and if approved it could create movement in the stock.</p><p><b>ArQule, Inc. (ARQL)</b> is a clinical stage biotechnology company developing cancer therapeutics. The stock has lost almost 70% of its value in the last year, mostly due to a recently failed study for its lead product, tivantinib. Much like NewLink, ArQule has evaluated its product on several different cancers, and is yet to experience success. In October, <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/ARQL.O/key-developments/article/2616751"">tivantinib failed to increase overall survival</a> in a Phase 3 lung cancer trial, but investors believe it was due to a variety of &quot;<a href=""http://www.arqule.com/res/onc/"">Met</a>&quot; expressions.</p><p>There are a number of potential catalysts for this stock. The company's shares should rebound nicely if tivantinib can be proven effective in treating cancer. In the next month the company will <a href=""http://www.biotechnologyevents.com/node/5361"">announce Phase 2 data</a> for tivantinib used to treat colorectal cancer. The company will also begin a Phase 3 liver cancer trial, enrolling only high Met expressions (some believe this strategy will be successful). With expectations being so low, it is very possible that the $158 million company's share price could rise significantly with a successful Phase 2 trial, and the initiation of the Phase 3 trial.</p><p><b>Zogenix, Inc. (ZGNX)</b> is a $141 million clinical stage biotechnology company that is developing therapies for the treatment of central nervous system disorders and pain. The company's lead product is Zohydro, an extend<span>ed-rele</span>ase hydrocodone, that has completed Phase 3 trials for patients needing constant opioid therapy. The company has other products in the pipeline, including Relday for treating schizophrenia; however, its immediate valuation is tied to Zohydro.</p><p>Last De<span>cember, an</span> <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-panel-opposes-pure-hydrocodone-214922797.html"">FDA panel voted against</a> Zohydro due to it being a stronger version of the commonly abused hydrocodone, and the stock lost 50% of its value. However, investors are hanging onto hope that the FDA will ignore the panel's risk concerns, which is uncommon but not impossible. With Zohyro being a stronger version of hydrocodone, there is no doubt that it does work and is effective, and we will learn on March 1 if the FDA believes the risk is worth the reward. If approved, the stock would climb greatly higher; though if approved, the company will most likely have very strict regulations on the drug, making its marketing more restricted and difficult.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>Each of the companies covered in this article have product-related catalysts in the coming weeks. There are some with a number of catalysts throughout the year. It's safe to assume that each company will be greatly altered in terms of valuation in 2013, and investors should appropriately value this risk. The stocks with low expectations, such as Zogenix and ArQule, might not fall to a large degree on bad news. And those with larger pipelines, such as NewLink and OncoSec, might be better protected if one product is unsuccessful. My suggestion is to watch each stock closely and expect large movement, one way or the other, in the coming weeks/months.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

"1786302","2013-10-30 08:00:51","NeoStem: Major Developments You Might Have Missed","<p>While investing in biotechnology, investors often overreact to key developments such as IP news, interim data, new hires, etc., all of which investors believe either increase or decrease a lead product's chance for clinical success. However, what investors tend to neglect is updated company presentations. For example, <strong>NeoStem</strong> (NBS), a company whose stock I own, <a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/e/131017/nbs8-k.html"">updated</a> an investor presentation earlier this month, yet surprisingly saw no stock gains as a result of this action. In this particular presentation, investors can quickly learn the details surrounding the company, but also gain access to new information that may not be realized by the investment community. I would like to focus on this particular NeoStem presentation, spotlighting <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/assets/NeoStem-Investor-Presentation1.pdf"">five key takeaways</a> from it.</p><p><strong>NeoStem: What You Need to Know</strong></p><p>In case you're not familiar with NeoStem: The company is often called &quot;complicated,&quot; but is mainly a clinical cell therapy company. It operates in four areas of clinical development, all of which are at different stages of development. NeoStem has a late phase product called AMR-001 that treats cardiovascular diseases; it has two early phase and preclinical programs using T-cells and embryonic-like cells to treat autoimmune diseases and degenerative diseases respectively; lastly it has a revenue-generating cell manufacturing business. As a result of having so many moving parts, questions and misconceptions often develop. Hence, the noted investor presentation helps to clarify many of these questions and misconceptions.</p><p><strong>An Integrated Business Model</strong></p><p>Seeking Alpha author Brian Nichols wrote a good article last month that called NeoStem an &quot;investment in <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1720392-neostem-an-investment-in-4-different-divisions"">four different divisions</a>.&quot; His goal was to explain what some might consider a very complicated company by breaking it down into four parts. Yet, this thought process might be a misconception, as NeoStem clearly sees its business model as an integrated collection of assets that all tie to its contract development and manufacturing organization, PCT. This is the NeoStem asset that produces revenue and that, in turn, aids in the development of all NeoStem's clinical products. This is important for the progression of the company, implicating PCT as the rope that ties everything together.</p><p><strong>Page 7 - PCT Clients</strong></p><p>Most investors who follow NeoStem know the basics of PCT; this is the company's manufacturing business. We know that PCT has a 15-year track record of success, including the treatment of more than 6,000 patients, with 55,000 square feet of facilities. However, one unknown has always been the identity of these clients and the number of PCT clients that exist.</p><p>Investors know a few clients, such as <strong>Baxter</strong> (BAX), <strong>ImmunoCellular Therapeutics</strong> (IMUC), and SOTIO. However, NeoStem notes 35 clients in its presentation, many of which include universities and hospitals. Looking closer, on the bottom of page 7 there is a list of several companies. NeoStem never particularly mentions these companies or says whether or not these companies are clients. However, one has to wonder why the likes of <strong>Dendreon</strong> (DNDN), <strong>Pfizer</strong> (PFE), Coronado, <strong>Osiris Therapeutics</strong> (OSIR), <strong>StemCells</strong> (STEM), and Prima Biomed are included.</p><p>Of course, investors already know that Prima is a client and that PCT manufactured Provenge while it was in clinical testing. Hitherto, NeoStem has always been a bit secretive in naming specific clients, other than those included in press releases, as some companies likely request confidentiality. Perhaps this list gives us an idea of the companies that NeoStem is working with in clinical development.</p><p>If so, we can conclude that such a list is impressive, and gives longs a reason to be bullish, as PCT continues to add clients quickly.</p><p><strong>Page 9 - Potential Revenue</strong></p><p>NeoStem investors have always wondered just how large PCT could become. Last year PCT's revenue nearly doubled over 2011, and during its last quarter, sales rose more than 70%. Still, this is a segment that is very much in its infancy as all of its clients are developing clinical products with NeoStem's revenue over the last 12 months just $14 million.</p><p>Perusing page 9 of the presentation, NeoStem provides a chart that shows just how lucrative PCT could become for the company (and shareholders). Essentially there are 15 stages, including low, medium, and high complexity products. These three product types then have five levels: pre-clinical, Phases 1-3, and then commercial manufacturing. As studies progress and PCT is forced to manufacture more products, its revenues increase.</p><p>Notably, a low complexity product in the preclinical phase might only produce revenue of $50,000 annually for PCT. However, a high complexity product in the same stage might earn $1 million. As products progress and enter Phase 3, PCT's sales range from $1-$10 million; then in the commercial stage peak sales can reach $250 million on just one high complexity product.</p><p>This chart or explanation of revenue clearly explains why PCT's revenue has soared over the last 2 years. As the company gains new clients and old clients enter larger studies, PCT's revenue grows larger. In particular, Baxter's CD34+ product is now in a large Phase 3 trial (most likely deemed high complexity) and could now produce $4-$10 million alone over the next two years.</p><p>Additionally, ImmunoCellular Therapeutics also entered into a Phase 2 trial for its brain cancer drug and could likely begin enrollment for a Phase 3 trial sometime next year. Or if data from its Phase 2 trial is robust, it may skip Phase 3 altogether and go straight to commercial manufacturing. While it's likely a medium complexity product, there is a $1-$2 million difference in the amount of revenue earned for PCT in the changing of Phase. This level of clarity further suggests that PCT could become a very large business in NeoStem's future, as it gains new clients and keeps current ones.</p><p><strong>Page 11 - Understanding the Pipeline</strong></p><p>Many investors who own shares of NeoStem, or many biotech investors who are familiar with the company, believe that NeoStem's clinical pipeline revolves around its Phase 2 product AMR-001. However, NeoStem is very diversified.</p><p>The following chart might not be news to current investors, but does show how diversified NeoStem is in its clinical approach. As can be observed, many of NeoStem's programs have advanced further, particularly autoimmune disorders. Nonetheless, NeoStem is treating diseases with large patient populations and continues to advance these studies, using PCT for manufacturing purposes to save with cost synergies.</p><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""0""><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup> <tr><td><p>Program</p></td><td><p>Indication</p></td><td><p>Status</p></td></tr> <tr><td><p><strong>Cardiovascular disease (AMR-001)</strong></p></td><td><p>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)</p></td><td><p>Phase 2</p></td></tr> <tr><td> </td><td><p>Congestive heart failure</p></td><td><p>Phase 1b/2a preparation</p></td></tr> <tr><td> </td><td><p>Traumatic brain injury</p></td><td><p>Preclinical</p></td></tr> <tr><td><p><strong>Autoimmune disorders (TREG)</strong></p></td><td><p>Type 1 diabetes</p></td><td><p>Phase 2 IND preparation</p></td></tr> <tr><td> </td><td><p>Steroid resistant asthma</p></td><td><p>Phase 1b/2a preparation</p></td></tr> <tr><td> </td><td><p>Organ transplant tolerance</p></td><td><p>Phase 1 IND</p></td></tr> <tr><td><p><strong>Tissue regeneration (VSELs)</strong></p></td><td><p>Periodontitis</p></td><td><p>IND</p></td></tr> <tr><td> </td><td><p>Macular degeneration</p></td><td><p>Preclinical</p></td></tr> <tr><td> </td><td><p>Osteoporosis</p></td><td><p>Preclinical</p></td></tr> <tr><td> </td><td><p>Acute radiation syndrome</p></td><td><p>Preclinical</p></td></tr> <tr><td> </td><td><p>Wound healing</p></td><td><p>Preclinical</p></td></tr></table><p>To reiterate, you likely already know the above information. Though if you didn't, then you can now understand the pure size of NeoStem's pipeline.</p><p><strong>Page 15 - Clinical Data</strong></p><p>AMR-001 is the company's most advanced product, being used to treat AMI. In the presentation, NeoStem showed how patients responded to different doses. The goal was to decrease left ventricular ejection fraction, or deterioration in heart muscle function.</p><p>When NeoStem used zero cells, approximately 30% of patients saw deteriorating heart function. When upped to five million cells, 40% of patients experienced deterioration. These results suggest nothing more than a dose under five million cells being placebo, in effect. However, when using 10 million cells, not one patient displayed heart function deterioration.</p><p>In case you don't know, this process is how clinical testing takes place. No company in the world has ever mixed a bag of chemicals together and found the solution to a complicated disease. Unfortunately, such a process takes trial and error and NeoStem went through this process to find a threshold dose, which had never before been defined. Hence, it was a medical breakthrough when NeoStem arrived at the threshold dose of 10 million cells and this has led to the pursuit of treating other diseases with AMR-001.</p><p><strong>Page 26 - Cash</strong></p><p>In addition to the 11 pages I've covered, there are another 10 pages with pictures, charts, and graphs explaining both TREGS and VSELs that you will find highly useful. But I want to conclude with the company's cash position.</p><p>As a result of warrant and option exercises and also the issuance of new stock, NeoStem raised $47.5 million from July 1 to October 15. This adds to the company's cash position of $14.7 million to give $62.2 million in cash to NeoStem's balance sheet.</p><p>In one year, NeoStem posted an operating loss of $33.89 million, but investors must remember that this came during the process of enrollment and site expansion for AMR-001. Accordingly, the next year should have lower costs during the waiting period for AMR-001 data. Either way, NeoStem now has enough cash to fund its business for the next two years!</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Considering the amount of positive momentum in the stock, the company's impressive clinical data and large pipeline, and its large revenue upside and client expansion in PCT, NeoStem's updated presentation is one that all investors should've read. In the future, such presentations should be a source of initial research and also an update of all new information regarding a company.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[BAX]], [[NBS]].

"998781","2012-11-12 00:40:39","Nordion's Future Does Not Look Bright","<p>Nordion Inc. (NDZ) is a global life sciences company that has continued to innovate annually even as global supply of medical isotopes continued to challenge the company. However, Nordion may have finally met its match via a company-changing development that puts a damper on its plan to replace the infamous NRU Reactor. The stock has since traded lower by 36% during the last two months, and appears to have few answers to its many questions.</p><p>Nordion and its competitor Covidien (COV) are, without a doubt, the global leaders in medical isotope production. Medical isotopes are necessary radioactive substances that are used in countless diagnostic procedures as well as treatments for cancer and other diseases. The production of these isotopes is a fast-paced logistical race to deliver the most common medical isotopes, such as Mo-99, from the nuclear reactor to the patients in need.</p><p>Nordion supplies the vast majority of Mo-99, the source of technetium-99, the most common isotope used to medical diagnostics. The catch is that in order to produce this medical isotope, a nuclear reactor must be utilized. This is where it gets tricky for Nordion, and its future: The company has faced supply issues for several years, but has survived by being able to create more effective medical isotopes via targeted therapies and such. However, most who follow the space have realized the looming threat of its largest and most significant reactor going offline, the NRU Reactor. Meanwhile, the company has been franticly seeking a solution, or a source of supply.</p><p>Aside from the possibility of lost revenue Nordion is seeking a replacement reactor because there are a number of companies with products/devices that rely on the production of Mo-99. For example, myocardial perfusion scans are very common, and companies such as General Electric (GE), with its <a href=""https://www2.gehealthcare.com/portal/site/usen/ProductDetail/?vgnextoid=1463173987140210VgnVCM10000024dd1403RCRD%26productid=0463173987140210VgnVCM10000024dd1403____"">Myoview</a>&reg; and other nuclear imaging devices of GE Healthcare use Tc-99m, which is created by the production of Mo-99. Scans such as this, and <a href=""http://www.cardiolite.com/healthcare-professionals/why-cardiolite.asp"">Cardiolite</a> from Brystol-Myers (BMY) are used most often in the U.S., and physicians and hospitals use these scans as part of diagnostics for insurance and even legal purposes.</p><p>If the NRU reactor goes offline without a viable solution, it will cause noticeable problems throughout a number of industries. Even companies such as DuPont (DD) use Mo-99, for <a href=""http://www2.dupont.com/ISCEON/en_US/products/ISCEON_MO99.html"">refrigerant</a>, as do other refrigerants manufacturers. With that being said, how do you replace something so common yet so widely used by most Americans? You really can't. Yet much like healthcare diagnostics, America is the largest consumer of Mo-99, meaning we would be the most affected by any shortages, or a complete lack of supply following an offline NRU reactor. These fears, and the possibility of Nordion not finding a solution, has taken its toll on the company, as investors begin to realize that the future is looking grim.</p><p>In the last two months Nordion has lost 35% of its value, as investors' worst fears became reality. The <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/nordion-announces-decision-arbitration-aecl-110000115.html"">company announced</a> on September 10 that it had received the decision in confidential arbitration with Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) that the company was denied monetary damages relating to the AECL's cancelled construction of MAPLE facilities. The company has been attempting to obtain a long-term, safe supply of medical isotopes, and was hoping to have found this with the MAPLE facilities.</p><p>The unsuccessful monetary claim on behalf of Nordion may have led to the decline, but the big news is that Nordion still does not have a viable source of Mo-99 once the NRU Reactor goes offline. This will be a major hit to its fundamentals, along with being a major hit to the healthcare industry. Nordion was hoping that these proceedings would ultimately lead to further construction of the facilities, however it is obvious that Canada is not willing, nor does it want, to host medical isotope production.</p><p>The warning signs of this lack of direction were looming prior to this news. During the company's Q3 2012 <a href=""http://wallstcheatsheet.com/stocks/nordion-earnings-call-nuggets-medical-isotope-business-amortization.html/?ref=YF"">conference call,</a> the company's executive staff seemed almost defensive and provided no clear vision, as executives appeared frustrated by the questions being asked. At one point, Lennox Gibbs of TD Newcrest asked, &quot;So, you don't really have a long-term view at this point, is that what you're saying?&quot; And CFO Peter Dan's almost robotic response, &quot;Again, just given the dynamics in this market it's something we can continue to monitor and we'll continue to provide update as they are available&quot; was nothing to create optimism among shareholders.</p><p>The big question for investors is what happens from this point? The global state of isotope production is concerning to say the least. Japan has shut down its last operating nuclear power reactor, Quebec has announced that it's shutting down its only reactor, Canada is obviously unwilling to fund or rebuild its reactors, and the U.S. is limited.</p><p>Nordion does have a backup supply in Russia and tried to ease the pain with news that it was <a href=""http://wallstcheatsheet.com/stocks/nordion-earnings-call-nuggets-medical-isotope-business-amortization.html/?ref=YF"">granted special permission</a> to enter into a negotiation directly with the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (RIAR) for Mo-99 supply. Nordion is attempting to negotiate an agreement with RIAR to supply Mo-99, as this partnership could meet a &quot;small portion&quot; of the demand. However the company is still seeking a more viable source.</p><p>My initial question was, &quot;what happens from this point?&quot; My belief is that we are beginning to see the start of a shift in power. Nordion is not well positioned to enter the U.S., which is one reason that Nordion has used the NRU Reactor for so many years. Up until this point, the U.S. has appeared almost unwilling to invest in nuclear energy. However, because of demand and need for the radioisotopes, it doesn't look as though we have much of a choice.</p><p>The University of Missouri Research Reactor is the most powerful of the reactors located at various universities throughout the country, is safe, and should be able to handle the majority of the country's <a href=""http://www.aapm.org/government_affairs/documents/IsotopeWhitePaperFinalCoalition07-14-09.pdf"">Mo-99 demand.</a> The reactor, in Missouri, is perfectly located to minimize logistical costs, and will be a big win for the company that earns its services once the NRU reactor goes offline and the U.S. is forced to produce medical isotopes on a large scale (probably within the next year).</p><p>Unfortunately, Nordion does not possess this relationship with MURR, but rather a small company called Advanced Medical Isotope Corp (ADMD.OB) has a joint venture with the MURR reactor. This small company has appreciated by more than 90% in the last six months as the prospects for Nordion continue to decline. Advanced Medical's joint venture includes a propriety compact method to produce Mo-99, and the company also believes that it can meet half of the U.S. demand in a fairly short period of time.</p><p>Advanced Medical is well positioned to capitalize on a market that Nordion is in the process of losing. The company has a very experienced and <a href=""http://www.isotopeworld.com/about-amic-/meet-the-experts/"">knowledgeable staff</a> that is not reflected in the company's valuation. The company's executives know the business, have a good grasp on demand, and are almost impeccably positioned to have a successful business that is similar to Nordion.</p><p>The consensus from most of the people who follow this industry and understand the operations is that Nordion will never be the same once the NRU reactor closes. It has already lost a significant amount of its valuation, but its plan to have partnerships with several different reactors not only increases its costs but also makes the logistics involved with producing Mo-99 nearly impossible.</p><p>Nordion shows a good presentation on its website entitled, &quot;<a href=""http://www.nordion.com/isotopes/index.asp""><em>Two Days in the Life of Mo-99</em></a>&quot;. This presentation shows how Nordion is always on a race against time to produce and then deliver the medical isotope, from Canada. So how can the company transport the same substances from Russia, or from some other country? The answer is that it can't? The reason Nordion has lost so much of its value is because the company apparently doesn't have an answer. The MURR reactor would have been a great fit, but Advanced Medical appears to now be in a position to capitalize on its possibilities, while others will likely take pieces of the market as a collective group to supply Mo-99. This may not be the conclusion that Nordion investors want to hear. But at this time, all facts indicate that this is the reality of the situation, and that Nordion's future does not look bright.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[ADMD.OB]].

"1017301","2012-11-19 07:38:50","4 Speculative Investments You Might Want To Consider","<p>In an unpredictable economy, it is never a good idea to have too many speculative stocks in your portfolio. You want a balanced number of cyclical and secular stocks, and you want to prepare yourself for what the market might face. The remainder of 2012 could be very volatile. In some ways, it seems as though the looming fiscal cliff drama is priced into the market. Yet, looking back at 2011, it seems clear that a political mess could push the market significantly lower. Accordingly, I am looking at a few speculative stocks that might be worth your attention, right now at current valuations, and could provide a bright spot to your portfolio. Each of these stocks carries an elevated level of risk, the reason for their current valuations, while still presenting significant upside with solid clinical data or increased sales, depending on the company. Interested investors should perform significant research into which, if any, of these speculative plays they are interested in and already have an exit plan in place if they do open a position.</p><p><strong>Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT)</strong> has rallied almost 200% in the last three months, and it has deserved every bit of its rally. The stock posted a one-day gain of 200% back on October 3 after <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-03/sarepta-therapeutics-rises-on-muscular-dystrophy-results"">clinical results</a> from its Muscular Dystrophy drug created a strong sense of optimism. The company's drug had met its primary goal as patients walked 292 feet further after taking the drug, compared to placebo. The drug, eteplirsen, also restored a key protein that was lacking in some patients with the disease. These results give patients with the disease hope, and analysts <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/ONCS.OB/key-developments/article/2643194"">project</a> that peak sales could exceed $600 million.</p><p>Since October 3, shares of Sarepta have fallen from a high of $45.00 to $26.50. However, the stock had fallen below $22.00 on October 31, but has since rallied to its current price, just under $26. The company is valued at $670 million, which is near equal to its peak projected sales. Most believe that its lead product will be awarded an FDA approval, and it appears as though the stock is in rally mode despite heavy selling pressure in the market. As a result, this speculative stock might be a clear buy as we progress to the end of the year as analyst upgrades could follow.</p><p>To suggest any upside or to speak positively of <strong>Peregrine Pharmaceuticals (PPHM)</strong> may do more harm than good; however, the truth is that PPHM is showing strong support at $0.70. This is a company that was valued at more than $550 million back in September, but is now trading with a market cap of just $75 million.</p><p>Most are aware of the story surrounding Peregrine: The company had traded higher in 2012 after positive data for its lead product, bavituximab, but then fell hard after announcing &quot;<a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/peregrine-pharmaceuticals-announces-discovered-major-113000402.html"">major discrepancies</a>&quot; in treatment group coding by an independent third-party vendor and was then forced to <a href=""http://www.dailyfinance.com/2012/09/27/peregrine-pays-the-price/"">default</a> on a $16 million loan. Despite these problems, the stock has since found support and may be worth a look. Keep in mind: This is a product being treated on patients who have failed first-line non-small cell lung cancer. And although <a href=""http://cancergrace.org/lung/2012/09/18/bavituximab-gerber-trial/"">the results</a> are questionable, it had a median overall survival of 12.1 months compared to 5.6 months for the control group.</p><p>The company's previously reported 12.1 month median survival is a strong advantage over standard-of-care, and considerably better than the two-month benefit for patients using Avastin. With this in mind, the question emerges whether or not the &quot;discrepancy&quot; means that the product is ineffective. Even if the &quot;discrepancy&quot; means that its product is only half as good as previously reported, it still trumps standard-of-care. This is definitely a high-risk investment; but with a $75 million market cap, it is priced for a worst-case scenario, and could present significant upside with minimum downside.</p><p><strong>OncoSec Medical (ONCS.OB)</strong> is a very small company that you many have never heard of, but one that has great upside potential. The company has more than doubled in the last six months and is currently trading near its support level at $0.30, as volume has increased in intensity over the last two months.</p><p>The medical device company recently announced data for two separate trials during the last two months. During this period, it has rallied by more than 50%. Both sets of data have been very encouraging; yet last week the company announced its most significant data from its metastatic melanoma trial. On Wednesday, the stock rallied more than 20% as the company met its end point and <a href=""http://www.sacbee.com/2012/11/15/4987692/oncosec-medical-reports-positive.html"">announced</a> positive interim efficacy results. But on Wednesday, it fell until finding support, a loss of 14%, when <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/ONCS.OB/key-developments/article/2643194"">details</a> of the data were released. The selloff appeared to be a &quot;sell on news&quot; type of event for what appeared to be solid data that will probably help the platform progress a step closer to regulatory approval in the U.S.</p><p>The company's data showed that 95% of all treated tumors demonstrated response to the company's ImmunoPulse therapy; however, the data was based on just over 50% of the patients who were enrolled when the study began. The good news is that with this data, and data from its Merkel cell carcinoma trial in October, the company has a technology that is being proven effective in several areas of treatment. The company is very diversified with a platform that could potentially address multiple types of solid tumor cancers. Although this treatment is a play in immunotherapy, the company also uses the same administration technology with a chemotherapy approach (NeoPulse), which has also proven to be very effective. Then, when you incorporate the fact that its technology can be used with virtually any chemotherapy or immunotherapy agent to decrease side effects and increase uptake, this is a company that could see immense profits with very little costs using previously approved cancer treatment agents.</p><p>Overall, this is one of the best under-the-radar stories of success in biotechnology. But judging by its increase in volume and its price action, people are starting to take notice. Looking ahead into the next few months, the stock should appreciate to a large degree, as more data will be announced. Don't be surprised if the stock rallies in the coming week now that it has found support. This stock could have doubled after its data, and I have no doubt that it will in the coming months. As with the other microcap companies in this article, investors should consider the risks, as this is a development-phase company that is not yet generating revenue and still being traded on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board exchange.</p><p>If I were to take a poll of investors, and asked the question, &quot;What is the most disappointing biotech stock of the last five years?&quot; most would resoundingly say, &quot;Dendreon Corporation.&quot; <strong>Dendreon (DNDN)</strong> was supposed to break barriers; it was supposed to change the landscape for treatments in oncology, and lead us into a new era of treatments in oncology. But instead, since reaching a high over $54.00 in 2010, the stock has been on a steady downtrend to its current price of $4.00.</p><p>There have been countless problems with Dendreon, but just to name a few: Investors did not anticipate high manufacturing and logistical costs, problems with reimbursements to physicians, and slower than expected sales growth. The company is now going through organizational changes, after closing its New Jersey facilities and laying off employees to cut costs. Although the company's plan appears to be working, as it managed to grow sales by more than 20% in its <a href=""http://investor.dendreon.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-12-448006%26CIK=1107332"">recent quarter</a> while posting a lower-than-expected loss.</p><p>The company is still operating at a loss, but recently gained additional coverage from Aetna and is in the middle of a trial that could create additional indications for the drug. With that being said, Dendreon appears to have found support at its current level, trading flat for the last month while the NASDAQ has lost 7.50% of its value. Much like Peregrine, this is a very risky investment; the company has a large amount of debt and is soon to face increased competition. Yet due to its valuation/potential ratio, I believe the stock could make a good investment over the next several months.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[SRPT]], [[ONCS.OB]].

"896721","2012-10-01 08:42:37","Interview With OncoSec CEO Punit Dhillon","<p>OncoSec Medical, Inc. (ONCS.OB) appears to be one of the bes<span>t-k</span>ept secrets in the biotech sector. As I have watched the developments over the last few months and see what could be in store in coming weeks and months, I can't help but think the upside for this $19 million company could be substantial for shareholders. However, with each spike in volume and share price as promising events unfold, the company's common shares seem to settle back to its current level of support around $0.20 per share. My view on the strange behavior of the company's stock price is fairly simple. Traders rather than shareholders have been creating liquidity and spikes in the share price with each positive PR. It is my opinion that these traders are content with quick 10-20% gains as they exit the stock and never look back. However, once true investors who are more interested in midterm and longer-term holdings begin buying the shares as they gain more of an understanding of what the company and its OMS platform is about, I anticipate a steadier uptrend to expected catalysts. It is these true long holders that will control the fate of the company's share price as they consume the float and traders have fewer shares to work with as the investors hold strong. However, until these shareholders understand where this company could be going, the stock chart could remain in the current tight range it is currently trading in.</p><p>I contacted OncoSec CEO and president, Punit Dhillon, in order to help us gain a better understanding of the company's plans and future prospects. He was gracious enough to answer a few questions to give us a better feel for where the company could be heading in the coming weeks, <span>months, </span>and years ahead.</p><p><strong><span>[CF]</span></strong><span> </span>Mr. Dhillon, thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to speak with me and your company's shareholders. It says a lot about a company's management when it is willing to step out of its comfort zone and address shareholders directly.</p><p><strong><span>[CEO]</span></strong><span> </span>Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to address any concerns and provide some answers for the shareholders who put faith and trust in our joint venture of company and investors.</p><p><strong><span>[CF]</span> </strong>Could you give us a status on the ongoing statistical re-evaluation of the NeoPulse phase III data?</p><p><strong>[CEO]</strong> We have completed analysis of the phase III H&amp;N cancer data and presented these results at this year's International Head and Neck Cancer Conference (July 2012 - Toronto, Canada). The abstract for this data presentation can be found <a href=""http://ahns.jnabstracts.com/Detail.aspx?ID=0778"">here</a> and our press release regarding the data <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-oms-electrochemotherapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-shows-enhanced-quality-of-life-in-two-randomized-phase-iii-studies"">here</a>. Currently, we are evaluating the extensive database of information obtained from both the phase III and IV NeoPulse trials pertaining to the pharmacoeconomic benefit for our therapy. These results will likely be published in Q1 2013.</p><p><strong><span>[CF]</span></strong> Would it be wise to have a third party review the data to present a more unbiased interpretation of the results?</p><p><strong>[CEO]</strong> Yes, it is always beneficial to have a third party review data from your clinical trials. However, with only so many resources and a strong focus on the ImmunoPulse program, it is currently not a priority for the company. Our focus for the NeoPulse program is to present the data to a number of specifically targeted potential partners for their evaluation as a license opportunity. If we can land a partner for this program, which we see as a near-term commercial opportunity, then we feel that this would be a significant validation of our data and the NeoPulse program.</p><p><strong>[CF] </strong>Will interim data for the two most advanced phase II ImmunoPulse trials come out in Q4 or could it be Q1 2013?</p><p><strong>[CEO]</strong> Interim analysis is currently on going for both the melanoma trial (OMS-I100) and the Merkel cell carcinoma trial (OMS-I110). These results are expected to be presented at a scientific conference before the end of 2012.</p><p><strong>[CF]</strong> I love the obvious adaptability of your OMS electroporation platform to potentially use any of a number of cancer treatment agents. Are there any plans on trying different chemotherapy or immunotherapy agents in the short to mid term?</p><p><strong>[CEO] </strong>Yes, the company is continuing to evaluate several different agents, both chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic, in combination with our OMS electroporation device.</p><p><strong>[CF]</strong> The trial data seems impressive so far. Can you put a &quot;real world&quot; perspective on the treatment in terms of its effect on an individual patient or patients?</p><p><strong>[CEO]</strong> Certainly. In a <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Melanoma-treatment-shows-promise-at-UCSF-3714590.php#ixzz27PZEkk8I"">recent article</a> in the San Francisco Chronicle, David Amoroso, a patient undergoing a clinical trial at UCSF using ImmunoPulse for metastatic melanoma, had only a 24% chance of living to see the next decade. He started the study in March 2012, and our OMS treatment &quot;seemingly zapped all but two of the six cancerous lumps that are evident.&quot; Mr. Amoroso commented &quot;the fact that four tumors are gone,&quot; he said, &quot;to me, seems successful.&quot; Mr. Amoroso elaborated comically on the only real side effects of the treatment &quot;you're getting 1,300 volts, and all of a sudden it just hits you and you're in shock for about two seconds and there's no residual pain following it. It really feels like somebody whacked you with a two-by-four on the side of your head without pain.&quot;</p><p><strong>[CF]</strong> What would you like to convey to potential shareholders from a financial and investment standpoint?</p><p><strong>[CEO]</strong> I believe OncoSec is extremely undervalued considering our data and efficacy results. Our phase I data are best in class for any metastatic melanoma program in history. We have met every milestone that we have set out to reach from the birth of the company, have been extremely aggressive in our timelines and have exceeded our enrollment expectations for our programs. We have exciting milestones coming up - all to be complete by the end of 2012. These include but certainly aren't limited to revealing subset data from our melanoma and Merkel cell program and potentially providing updates on deals pertaining to our NeoPulse program.</p><p><strong>[CF] </strong>Share price isn't there yet, but are there plans on uplisting to the big boards?</p><p><strong>[CEO]</strong> Yes, the plan to uplist is in our future.</p><p><strong>[CF] </strong>What sets OncoSec and its platform apart from the rest of the novel cancer therapies currently in development?</p><p><strong>[CEO]</strong> OncoSec is uniquely positioning itself in the cancer immunotherapy space. For many years, scientists and clinicians have known that many cancers are caused by a dysfunction of the immune system, and as a result they have identified numerous immunological targets with potentially powerful benefits. Unfortunately, until now, the significance of these discoveries in terms of translation into success in the clinic has been disappointing largely in part due to the inability to properly deliver enough of these new agents to elicit a response while maintaining an acceptable level of safety for the patient.</p><p>Recently, new methods of delivery have been established such as viral vectors, cationic liposomes or autologous cell delivery, which carry DNA, or molecular instructions, directly to the cell to produce an immunogenic agent. This has been a revolution in cancer drug delivery because this route of administration not only targets the tumor directly, it also reduces the amount of agent required to elicit a therapeutic effect - therefore theoretically leading to potential improved responses and patient safety. Clinical trials using these routes of administration have demonstrated some success, but they have also come with some pitfalls. Early trials using adenoviral vectors resulted in significant safety issues, which have unfortunately delayed the development of this approach. Fortunately, it appears that these safety issues have been resolved and a number of companies have continued to develop immunotherapies using this viral vector approaches, however, it still remains unclear as to the long-term effects for the patient when delivering a biologic agent such as a virus. Cationic liposomes have demonstrated safety and some efficacy as well, however, the transfection efficiency (i.e. the ability to deliver the DNA to the cell with minimal effort and energy) is in question. As a result, clinical trials using this delivery method often require a number of treatments which can extend as long as 6-8 weeks. Lastly, the autologous cell delivery approach has recently received significant attention in cancer immunotherapy because it is the mode of delivery of choice of PROVENGE, the first cancer immunotherapy ever approved in the US. However, the attention received has been quite negative, particularly because it appears that this method, though effect, has proven to be prohibitively expensive for many patients and healthcare providers to consider as a primary or even secondary treatment option.</p><p>On the other hand, OncoSec has an established delivery method, electroporation, which provides the same benefits, while reducing the mitigating concerns related to other intralesional therapies. The OMS device uses electric fields to efficiently deliver DNA into cells. These electric fields are inert and dissipate once the electroporation is stopped, thus there is no concern about residual long-term effects. Moreover, the efficiency of delivery using electroporation is significantly better than other approaches. Where other treatments can last several weeks, results from our phase I study demonstrated that only 1-week of treatment could result in clinical benefit for late-stage cancer patients. Lastly, OncoSec's approach is simple and cost-effective. It is being developed as a potential out-patient clinic treatment, and the cost of goods for the company (i.e. device and DNA) is minimal. Taken all together, the ImmunoPulse treatment has demonstrated improved safety, efficacy and cost.</p><p><strong>[CF] </strong>Sounds impressive and promising. Are any regulatory filings/trials planned for international markets?</p><p><strong>[CEO]</strong> Yes, the company does expect to eventually target international markets. However, our focus is currently on the success of our ongoing clinical trials and executing on the development plan for the ImmunoPulse program.</p><p><strong>[CF]</strong> Any final words for current or potential shareholders?</p><p><strong>[CEO]</strong> In less than two years, OncoSec has started three phase II clinical trials. Two of which have already exceeded enrollment goals. When you look at our data and efficacy results, along with our clinical pipeline and company milestones, it can definitely be argued that OncoSec is extremely undervalued. We are targeting a deadly disease that is only growing and escalating year-by-year, and current treatment options have shown to be expensive with major quality of life consequences. OncoSec has hit every milestone we have set out to reach and plan to continue this trend. We have exciting milestones coming up and plan to announce subset data on our melanoma program and Merkel cell carcinoma program in upcoming months.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[ONCS.OB]].

"309606","2011-11-22 11:51:24","Lipid Signaling Could Shake Up Biotech In 2012 With Pending Lpath And Peregrine Trial Data","<p>Modern medicine has undergone a revolution in the past three decades with the advents of genomics and more recently with the field of proteomics.  Lipidomics, the study of pathways and networks of cellular lipids in biological systems, could likely start dominating biotech headlines as pharmaceuticals and the medical community start focusing on lipid signaling and how its control could be used to fight disease.  The modern biotech and Big Pharma experience with lipids had been focused on what was thought to be the only important functions of lipids in the biological system, energy storage and structural component of cell membranes. However, the newly discovered third function of lipids, lipid signaling, could be leading a revolution in how many diseases and their treatments are approached.</p> <p>Lipid signaling refers to any physiological signaling event involving a lipid messenger that binds a protein target, such as a receptor, kinase or phosphatase, which in turn mediate the effects of these lipids on specific cellular responses. These cellular responses include the ability of cells to perceive and correctly respond to their biological environment and are the basis of development, tissue repair, and immunity as well as normal cell (and thus tissue) homeostasis. Any disruption of these processes can lead to a host of cancers, autoimmune diseases, inflammations and other ailments.  Current regulation of these signaling pathways involve two predominate approaches, elimination of these bioactive lipids or tying up their receptor sites which effectively neutralizes the signaling function.</p> <p><strong>Novartis (NVS)</strong>, in terms of regulatory approval, led the way with its September 2010 approval of Gilenya, a first-line treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. This approval made Gilenya the first oral treatment indicated for relapsing forms of MS available in the US and underscores the importance of where this fledgling field is headed. Gilenya is the first in a new class of drugs called sphingosine1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulators. Although the exact mechanism by which the drug itself works is still unclear, it is thought to work by reducing the immune system's attack on the central nervous system by retaining certain white blood cells in the lymph nodes. This prevents them from reaching the CNS, where they could attack the protective covering around the nerve fibers, resulting in less inflammatory damage to the nerve cells seen in multiple sclerosis patients. Gilenya&rsquo;s efficacy data speaks for itself with <span>Phase III data showing a reduction in MS relapses by over 52% relative to Biogen Idec&rsquo;s (BIIB) Avonex.  Additional data from a two-year placebo-controlled study showed a reduction in relapse rate (54% reduction P&lt;0.001, relative to placebo) and risk of disability progression among Gilenya patients (30% reduction confirmed at three-month follow-up visit P=0.02, relative to placebo).</span></p> <p><strong>Peregrine Pharmaceuticals&rsquo; (PPHM)</strong> pipeline includes a monoclonal antibody that targets a conjugated protein-lipid. Its lead candidate, Bavituximab, is a first-in-class phosphatidylserine ((PS))-targeting monoclonal antibody, a new approach to treating cancer. PS is a highly immunosuppressive molecule usually located inside the cell membrane of healthy cells.  However it inverts and becomes exposed on the outside of cells that line cancer tumor blood vessels.  For cancer researchers, this becomes a key target by which to attack the cancer. PS-targeting antibodies target and bind to PS and block the immunosuppressive signal, enabling the immunity system to recognize and fight the tumor.</p> <p>Bavituximab has shown promise in several oncology indications but is currently in <span>Phase II studies for Peregrine in front-line and second line non-small cell lung cancers ((NSCLC)), breast cancer and pancreatic cancer.  The front-line NSCLC <span>Phase II trial is evaluating Bavituximab with Paclitaxel and Carboplatin versus Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in 86 patients. Enrollment in this trial has completed with interim data from the study likely released in Q4 2011.  In June 2011 Peregrine released interim data indicating a Median Overall Survival ((MOS)) of 12.4 months using Bavituximab in combination with Carboplatin and Paclitaxel compared to 10.3 months MOS from a separate historical control trial using Carboplatin and Paclitaxel.  <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Peregrine-Reports-Promising-iw-516177917.html?x=0""><span>Phase II data</span></a> for patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were released in August 2011 with promising results.  A 20.7 month MOS from a prior single-arm <span>Phase II trial evaluating Bavituximab in combination with Docetaxel compared very favorably relative to Docetaxel alone with a historical MOS of 11.7 months, a 77% improvement.  Key here is the lipid-signaling approach they&rsquo;re taking by focusing on the phosphatidylserine bioactive lipid appears to be working and has demonstrated efficacy across a broad range of cancers thus far. </span></span></span></p> <p><strong>Lpath, Inc. (LPTN.OB)</strong> has taken the approach of targeting bioactive lipids and the science of lipidomics to a different level with its proprietary platform, Immune Y2 technology.  Instead of attacking or neutralizing the receptor sites involved with the pathways, Lpath has created monoclonal antibodies against the lipids themselves. These antibodies are the foundation behind the company&rsquo;s lead product candidates iSONEP, ASONEP, and Lpathomab.  Essentially, these antibodies &ldquo;sponge up&rdquo; the targeted lipids and fully bind all receptor sites, stopping the pathway signaling cold.</p> <p>iSONEP is a monoclonal antibody against SP1 with indication of treating retinal diseases.  Lpath initiated the first of two proof-of-concept trials in <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Lpath-Initiates-Dosing-iSONEP-iw-2686942002.html?x=0"">September of 2011</a>, the first of which is termed the PEDigree trial in which iSONEP is being studied as a treatment for retinal pigment epithelium detachment.  Lpath plans to dose 32 subjects that have PED secondary to wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) or polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy ((PCV)).  In October 2011, Lpath initiated its Nexus <span>Phase II trial on iSONEP as a treatment for wet AMD.   In the earlier <span>Phase I trial, iSONEP met its primary endpoint of being well tolerated and also succeeded in meeting a key secondary endpoint in that a positive biological effect was observed in most patients in a single dose, many who had failed to respond positively to Lucentis and/or Avastin (off-label indication for the latter) treatments.  In order to succeed for this indication, iSONEP needs to have non-overlapping success relative to current treatments.  Lpath thinks iSONEP will meet these non-overlapping efficacy requirements based on <span>Phase I data.  In that trial an occult sub-group indicated regression of the CNV lesions with 2 of 2 patients showed good resolution of RPE detachment, both key endpoints in which could allow a path to regulatory acceptance if the results carry over to final trials with at least similar efficacy on the other symptoms <a href=""http://www.lucentis.com/lucentis/"">Lucentis</a> regulates.</span></span></span></p> <p>Although still early in the regulatory path, <strong>Pfizer (PFE)</strong> is apparently convinced enough with the Immune Y2 technology that is has already inked a <a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=197881&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1509317&amp;highlight="">contract</a> with Lpath for iSONEP, one that netted Lpath <a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/e/110323/lptn.ob10-k.html"">$14 million</a> on January 2011.  Additional clauses in the deal could net Lpath regulatory and commercial milestone payments that could total up to $497.5 million plus double-digit royalties to iSONEP pending approval.  The agreement also gives Pfizer a time-limited right of refusal on ASONEP (another formulation of the same SP1 antibody as iSONEP) for the treatment of cancer.  A <span>Phase II trial on ASONEP will initiate in 2012 for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and will be a huge catalyst for the company&rsquo;s common stock and will add to the excitement that the PEDigree trial results should give investors in Q2 2012 as well.</span></p> <p>Lpath has huge plans for 2012 with its growing pipeline and possible uplisting to the NASDAQ or AMEX stock exchanges.  As icing on the cake, the agreement with Pfizer and other funding obtained has shored up Lpath&rsquo;s balance sheet giving it sufficient cash to likely operate into June 2013 per current plans.  Stock offering (dilution) concerns present in so many development <span>Phase biotechs should be minimal to 1Q 2013 at least.  Not thinking short-term, Lpath has been securing its intellectual properties with <a href=""http://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/Lpath+Granted+Two+Additional+U.S.+Patents+Related+to+iSONEP+and+ASONEP+Drug+Programs/6834943.html"">patents</a> it hopes to protect its technology and applications. These patents add value to the company and its pipeline by protecting against competition and giving it a stronghold by which to license out its technology in the future as trial successes build its pipeline.</span></p> <p>This is the biotech arena, and it not forgiving to investors who choose poorly but can be profitable to those lucky enough or wise enough to make the correct decisions. Although late-entry positions in Lpath, Inc. or Peregrine Pharmaceuticals will likely still afford investors moderate gains after trial results are reported and milestone payments are announced, entry well before those huge catalysts will likely afford investors substantial gains many multiples over the later entry ones.  Entry into NVS common stock at this time with its $131 billion market cap, although a much safer investment, does not have nearly the potential gains with its successes as positive trials in $72.5 million market cap PPHM or $55 million LPTN.  Investors, Big Pharma and the medical community will be watching as the lipidomics medical revolution comes with Novartis, Peregrine Pharmaceuticals and Lpath, Incorporated leading the way.</p>  <p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>Long position in PPHM.</p>"
"1317151","2013-04-03 07:57:49","Medical Isotope Producers Could Be Lucrative Investment Ventures","<p>Medical isotopes are gaining traction in the fight against cancer and other diseases. Medical isotopes provide safe, cost-effective diagnostics and treatment for cancer and other diseases. Medical isotopes help us learn more about diseased tissue by tracking its movement from the inside, as opposed to standard diagnostic procedures, which take pictures from the outside. Medical isotopes usage often results in an earlier disease diagnosis, which allows patients to be treated in a timely manner, resulting in increased survival rates. Medical isotopes also help kill off diseased cells. The energy transmitted by radioisotopes can destroy these cells. When medical isotopes are delivered straight to the site of a tumor or group of cancer cells, cancer cells are selectively killed off while healthy tissues are spared. Even more promising, the latest technologies used in fighting cancer enable medical isotopes to be delivered directly to the tumor site or group of diseased cells.</p><p>Investing in medical isotope producers now could prove to be highly lucrative in the coming years. In this article, I will focus on medical isotope producer <strong>Advanced Medical Isotope Corp (ADMD.OB)</strong>, and also discuss two competitors, <strong>Nordion (NDZ)</strong> and <strong>Covidien (COV)</strong>, to see if any investment opportunities are present in this fast-growing space.</p><p><strong>Radiopharmaceutical Market</strong></p><p><a href=""http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/radiopharmaceuticals-market-417.html"">According</a> to the highly notable market research and consulting firm, <em>Marketsandmarkets.com</em>:</p><blockquote><blockquote class=""quote""><p><em>&quot;The global radiopharmaceuticals market, which was valued at $3.8 billion in 2012, is expected to reach $5.5 billion by 2017. In addition, diagnostic procedures using Technetium-99m are forecasted to increase approximately 15% to 20% in Europe, North America, Korea and Oceania between 2010 and 2030. Radiopharmaceuticals are preferred by medical practitioners to complement conventional treatment of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementia. Radioisotopes, such as Ra-223 (Alpharadin) and Ga-68, possess huge potential for clinical applications. The therapy market is predominantly driven by its oncologic applications. Since conventional treatment procedures of cancer, surgery and chemotherapy have significant side effects, radioisotopes are being preferred by medical practitioners due to minimum or no side effects.&quot;</em></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>However, the scheduled shutdown of the NRU reactor in 2016 and OSIRIS in France in 2018 is creating a big long-term challenge for manufacturers in the radiopharmaceutical market.</p><p>North America currently holds a 49% share of the global diagnostic radioisotope market, with the U.S. as the largest consumer of radiopharmaceuticals and Canada as one of the largest producers of technetium-99m. According to the most recent <a href=""http://www.parl.gc.ca/content/LOP/ResearchPublications/prb0904-e.htm"">data</a> available, the U.S. accounts for approximately 44% of total global demand of molybdenum-99 and technetium-99m.</p><p><a href=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/4/4313511_13648738262889_0.jpg"" rel=""lightbox""><img src=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/4/4313511_13648738262889_0_thumb.jpg"" /></a></p><p>Five government-owned reactors fill 95% of the global demand for molybdenum-99. The NRU reactor in Ontario, Canada is the world's largest reactor, followed by the Petten reactor in the Netherlands, the BR2 reactor in Belgium, the OSIRIS reactor in France, and the SAFARI reactor in South Africa. In addition, 95% of the world's supply of technetium-99 is <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2012/02/20/health-medical-isotope-shortage.html"">produced</a> at five nuclear reactors around the world, including the National Research Universal ((NRU)) reactor in Chalk River, Ontario.</p><p>The heavy water leak in 2009 led to the shutdown of the NRU reactor for more than a year that resulted in a worldwide shortage of medical isotopes, forcing the cancellation of some medical imaging scans. A similar reactor in the Netherlands was forced to shut down temporarily for maintenance during the NRU shutdown, worsening the problem.</p><p><strong>Advanced Medical Isotope Corp.</strong></p><p>Advanced Medical Isotope provides radioisotopes for innovative technologies such as RadioGel, which enable more effective and less risky radiology procedures (brachytherapy) for treatment of cancer and other illnesses. A key advantage of Advanced Medical Isotope's technology, in addition to the fact that it is far more readily available, is that it is also far more cost effective. Advanced Medical Isotope enables critical lifesaving treatments such as <a href=""http://www.isotopeworld.com/cancer-treatments/bracheatherapy/"">brachytherapy</a> and <a href=""http://www.isotopeworld.com/cancer-treatments/injectable-radiogel/"">RadioGel and Seed Technology</a>. RadioGel in particular is groundbreaking in that it does not cause any harm to tissue surrounding the infected area, effectively targeting only the cancerous tissue.</p><p>RadioGel therapy <a href=""http://www.auntminnie.com/index.aspx?sec=ser%26sub=def%26pag=dis%26ItemID=102406"">involves injection</a> of a water-based biodegradable polymer that delivers yttrium-90 microspheres directly into tumorous tissue. The solution warms to body temperature quickly after injection and then polymerizes into a lattice that traps the yttrium-90 (a cost effective radioactive element) microspheres in place. Because it involves lesser treatment and healing time than any other surgical method, and due to the inclusion of yttrium-90, it becomes more effective and economical in terms of costs of hospitalization and recovery.</p><p><strong>Partnerships</strong></p><p>In March 2013, Advanced Medical Isotope <a href=""http://mstockwire.com/2013/03/amic-enters-into-strategic-alliance-with-gsg-international/"">negotiated</a> an agreement with GSG International GMbH to produce, market, and distribute the related isotopes, equipment and services. The first attempt for this alliance is going to focus on the distribution of molybendum-99 (Mo-99) and related technetium-99 generators and kits that are acquired or manufactured by GSG on behalf of the alliance.</p><p>Advanced Medical Isotope, along with Safety by Design, PC, Colorado and Colorado State University, have entered into an agreement to manufacture and supply medical isotopes in areas with high demand and low supply. Their initial focus is on the treatment of skin cancer, then on using the same isotope (holmium-166) to treat joint pains, liver cancer, and myeloma.</p><p>In addition, the company has also obtained an exclusive license for RadioGel from Battelle, the world's largest independent research and development organization, for eight patents to produce, use, and sell the water-based biodegradable polymer product that transfuses the yttrium-90 microspheres directly into infected tissues.</p><p><strong>Nordion &amp; Covidien</strong></p><p>Advanced Medical Isotope has <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/998781-nordion-s-future-does-not-look-bright?source=feed"">outperformed</a> peers like <strong>Nordion</strong>, one of the global leaders in medical isotope production, in terms of sustaining its supply of medical isotopes. The biggest issue facing Nordion currently is its lack of molybdenum-99 due to the NRU Reactor shutdowns. Nordion currently produces most of the world's supply of molybdenum-99, which is a source of technetium-99, a widely used isotope in medical diagnostics. Nordion's survival has depended on its creation of more effective medical isotopes for use in targeted therapies. Since many companies in different industries rely on Mo-99, Nordion faces a significant risk of revenue loss.</p><p>In mid-March, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) <a href=""http://www.nordion.com/isotopes/news.asp"">announced</a> a 30-day planned shutdown for inspection and maintenance of the NRU reactor. Atomic Energy of Canada Limited is Nordion's primary supplier of medical isotopes. The shutdown is expected to last from mid-April until mid-May, and will interrupt the supply of medical isotopes.</p><p>Nordion is exposed to risks involved with medical isotope production shortages. While Nordion reported revenue of $53.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, compared to $53 million for the same period in 2012, adjusted net income decreased to $4.1 million in the quarter from $7.1 million during the same period in 2012. The company reported first quarter fiscal 2013 adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share ((EPS)) of $0.07, compared to $0.11 in the first quarter of 2012. I believe Nordion's vulnerable position in terms of isotope production makes it a questionable investment for those looking for exposure to the medical isotope market. Investors looking for exposure to this space should watch carefully for any new developments surrounding the NRU reactor.</p><p><strong>Covidien</strong> has been dealing with similar supply issues. The company's isotopes primarily come from nuclear reactors in Europe and South Africa. Covidien, which is highly dependent on HEU materials used to produce its Mo-99 isotopes, has taken steps to convert from HEU to LEU isotopes. The company has announced a plan to convert its Netherlands Petten Mo-99 processing facility. However, the company's size has reduced the impact of isotope supply shortages on its bottom line.</p><p>Covidien's net sales jumped 5%, while sales of medical devices jumped 8%. Covidien reported first quarter net sales of $3.06 billion, compared to $2.90 billion in the same quarter of 2012. The company reported first-quarter GAAP earnings per share of $1.03. Covidien plans to announce second quarter 2013 results toward the end of April. Due to its size, Covidien has much less exposure risk in the medical isotope space than Nordion.</p><p>Advanced Medical Isotope has created a reliable, domestic Mo-99 supply and distribution system. Its potential joint venture with MU Research Reactor to produce Mo-99 is part of its overall supply strategy. In addition, it has access to a subcritical system (technically and legally not a nuclear reactor, thus avoiding significant and costly regulations) that will enable it to continually produce effective and economical isotopes. Advanced Medical Isotope, despite being a small player in its field, has been able to consistently produce and sell higher quality medical isotopes while continuing to meet demand levels for the product.</p><p>The company has eight patented medical therapies:</p><ul><li>&quot;Stimulus Sensitive Gel with Radioisotope and Methods of Making &quot;- in U.S. with two different patent numbers.</li><li>&quot;Sensitive Gel with Radioisotope and Methods of Making&quot;- in Canada</li><li>&quot;Thermogelling Biodegradable Aqueous Polymer Solution&quot;- in U.S.</li><li>&quot;ThermogellingOligopeptide Polymers&quot;- in U.S.</li><li>&quot;Thermogelling Biodegradable Aqueous Polymer Solution&quot;- in Canada.</li><li>&quot;Multiple Stimulus Reversible Hydrogels&quot;- in U.S. with two different patent numbers.</li></ul><p>Advanced Medical Isotope obtained the exclusive license to these eight patents for the Radiogel technology back in February 2011. As mentioned earlier, with these patents, Advanced Medical Isotope has the right to produce and sell the RadioGel platform.</p><p>Advanced Medical Isotope took its first step in the pre-market approval process in early February 2013 in submitting data on RadioGel to the FDA. The company estimates the entire FDA approval process for RadioGel to cost somewhere between $5.5 million and $8 million. Advanced Medical Isotope did secure funding in October 2010 through a grant from the Department of Energy in the amount of $1.2 million.</p><p>Currently, the company's stock is trading around $0.13, between a 52-week range of $0.08 and $0.30. One big factor that could cause the stock to continue growing is the passing of the <a href=""http://www.snm.org/index.cfm?PageID=12268"">American Medical Isotope Production Act</a>. The company's key position should allow it to gain access to funding here. Funding will be supplied to companies based on the time to start production of Mo-99, the capacity to meet a big portion of Mo-99 demand, and the total cost of the project.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The key to Advanced Medical Isotope's future rests in its ability to secure the necessary funding to get RadioGel through the FDA approval process and into production. Investors who believe in the company's vision should consider buying the stock. I believe the company's proprietary technology and access to a stable supply of input materials will weigh heavily in its favor when securing additional funding.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[ADMD.OB]], [[COV]].

"816081","2012-08-19 15:24:36","The Future Looks Sweet For Monsanto As New Opportunities In Agribusiness Emerge","<p>Genetically Modified Products Are a Force for Good and Here to Stay</p><p>Monsanto (MON) is the undisputed leader in providing agricultural products to farmers around the globe. Through its seeds and genomics division it creates the highest-yielding plant seed optimized for specific growing conditions. Corn, soybean, canola, cotton, and most vegetables are represented in Monsanto's stable of genetically modified seeds. Monsanto's agricultural productivity segment provides glyphosate-based herbicides for industrial, agricultural, ornamental, and turf applications. At its core, Monsanto is a sort of biotech for agricultural applications, and its world-beating products, prolific R&amp;D budget, and global distribution channel gives it an economic moat that allows it to thrive in good economic times and bad.</p><p>People need to eat and farmers want to optimize yield to make a profit. This is why the reliability and steady growth of Monsanto's earnings enables the company to create such value for its shareholders-- the stock is near all-time highs and it enjoys mega-cap status to the tune of $48 billion dollars. Not bad for a company (the original Monsanto) that started to gain traction in the 80s with its nascent seed business and as the purveyor of artificial sweeteners (NutraSweet) that was purchased from G.D. Searle in 1982.</p><p>That Monsanto's future lies at the nexus of biotech and the consumer adoption of plant byproducts derived from genetically modified seeds is not up for debate. Whether consumers like it or not, the &quot;brave new world&quot; of food is destined to include completely natural products originating from genetically engineered seeds. This is the future, and the debate is largely over regarding the safety of products derived from genetically modified seed stock. All grains and vegetables have been genetically engineered through selective harvesting over millennia. So the discussion over what is &quot;natural&quot; becomes a disingenuous intellectual exercise if we fail to look at the history of human engineering of seed stock. It is best to frame the debate in terms of the safety and efficacy of the byproducts of these seeds: the fruit, vegetable or grain that ultimately hits the dinner plate of the consumer. The market will decide whether the quality of such an item is fit to hit end-user markets.</p><p>The resurgence of buying locally sourced fruits and vegetables is a testament to the power of consumer choices governed by the desire to eat healthy organic foods. Monsanto will carve out its future along these lines: the highest-quality product that can be produced at the lowest-possible cost. Consumers will pay a premium for heirloom quality tomatoes until one is developed that has the hardiness and yield of current seed stock. Preferably, it can be produced close to end-user markets to cater to a consumer class that is keeping sustainability in mind. It is all about moving up the value chain. Monsanto recognizes this and will be looking to create value in a product portfolio that will likely expand in scope and quality. One area that is ripe for innovation is the plant sciences with respect to natural sweeteners.</p><p>Enter Stevia, the Natural Zero Calorie Sweetener</p><p>It seems that chemically derived zero-calorie sweeteners are losing their luster in the minds of the ever more fickle and sophisticated consumers who are gravitating to natural unprocessed foods. The first crest of this wave has been the emergence of an entire supply chain oriented to providing healthy alternatives to the masses. The success of such enterprises speaks for itself: Whole Foods (WFMI), Sprouts Markets, and entire divisions of Wal-Mart (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/wmt"">WMT</a>) are now happily catering to a demographic that takes to heart the mantra &quot;you are what you eat.&quot;</p><p>In an era where a premium is assigned to health-oriented consumption, it is likely that this generation of &quot;label reading&quot; shoppers will reach for zero or low calorie beverages and food products that can now tout natural, plant-derived sweeteners. Stevia (as derived from the stevia plant) has the blessing of both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ((FDA)) and the European Union for use in food and beverages, and this is changing the landscape of what is now (as of 2010) an over $58 billion global sweetener industry.</p><p>Even the World Health Organization has weighed in with studies showing that stevia could replace up to 20% of all dietary sweeteners. A company called Stevia First Corp. (STVF.OB) is the leading California agribusiness with a clear focus on development and production of the highest-quality natural sweetener at a time when consumers are looking for alternatives to sugar and chemically derived sweeteners.</p><p>Location Matters: The &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; of Agribusiness</p><p>So how can established companies like Monsanto or an emerging company like Stevia First Corp. position themselves to capture this burgeoning market? One element for building a leadership position in this niche includes being close to the end-user markets (read the U.S.) and to have access to the best California based science and production techniques that will enable it to produce a higher quality product at potentially lower price points. Stevia First Corp. company Chairman, Avtar Dhillon, has alluded to the benefits and location of production in central California, &quot;Add a scientific approach and we have a good chance to come out with the right plant in the right soil with the right techniques for growing and harvesting.&quot; By leveraging expertise in California's Central Valley (what many consider to be the &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; for agriculture), Stevia First has an opportunity to develop a leadership position in the technologies related to cultivation, processing, and formulation, allowing it to potentially &quot;leapfrog&quot; its international competition and put pressure on companies like Monsanto to enter the fray.</p><p>Stevia First Corp. has bigger plans than merely being a producer of the natural sweetener however. The goal is to be the first to create a vertically integrated enterprise in a region that can support an almost unlimited amount of production. Chip Morris, the director of farming operations for Stevia First, has maintained that &quot;California could become the stevia production capital of the world. The market for all natural, zero-calorie stevia is exploding.&quot; Clearly, there are big domestic plans for a compound whose production, to date, has primarily taken place in China. With R&amp;D operations and more than 1000 acres of land at its disposal in California's Central Valley, Stevia First plans to capitalize on the demand for locally and sustainably derived ingredients. The location allows it to cull biotech expertise from such institutions as UC Davis and provides access to U.S. federal research grants.</p><p>R&amp;D Capabilities and Pedigree Key to Value Added Production and World Class Customers</p><p>By moving up the value chain and creating separation from low-quality, high-volume production, emerging companies have the ability to become premier global suppliers of branded products in the food and beverage industries. For an established company like Monsanto, it means looking at this new market through R&amp;D channels or making an acquisition to gain exposure to it. Monsanto has done this before: in its skillful co-opting, production, and enhanced branding of NutraSweet, whose FDA approval and consequent commercial success in the '80s prompted Monsanto to purchase G.D. Searle (the developer of NutraSweet).</p><p>It was indeed a sweet and profitable ride for investors in both entities, and it stands to reason that as the evolution of stevia unfolds, the highest value producers with the best access to technology, capital markets, and ties to the major U.S. food brands (think Coca-Cola (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ko"">KO</a>), Pepsi (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/pep"">PEP</a>) and others) will be best positioned to succeed. Stevia First seems to have the pedigree to best meet the marketplace as the premier value-added supplier with the scale and sophistication to bring stevia-derived products into the mainstream.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.</p>"

"810301","2012-08-15 20:07:07","ICT-107 Into Perspective: Part 1","<p>Over the past year, I've written several articles about ImmunoCellular Therapeutics (IMUC) and its lead product, ICT-107, discussing the technology behind the cancer vaccine. On Tuesday, I published an article which presented the company's recent <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/805871-dr-keith-black-talks-ict-107"">special with Dr. Sanjay Gupta</a>, which puts into perspective the company's progress and its breakthrough in the medical community. However, I decided to break it down further, and in this article I am looking at the disease of glioblastoma multiforme, ICT-107 compared to current treatments, and also what it needs to achieve in order to reach an FDA approval. Later, in part 2 of this article, I will be looking at the manufacturing process of ICT-107 and compare it to current processes as well as expectations, potential revenue and profitability if approved. My goal, is to put this technology and its candidate into perspective, and provide a complete assessment of the biotechnology company, from all aspects.</p><p><strong>Company</strong></p><p>ImmunoCellular Therapeutics is often compared to Dendreon (DNDN), as both are part of the immunotherapy space, which has been made popular by DNDN due to its first approval with the drug Provenge. Dendreon has had its share of problems with Provenge, as the future is now uncertain, however Dendreon did open the door for other immunotherapy companies that have come behind it and improved upon the technology, such is the case with IMUC.</p><p>IMUC has had an exciting year so far; the company was recently <a href=""http://www.imuc.com/imuc-06-18-2012"">added</a> to several Russell Index funds after being <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/621651-immunocellular-therapeutics-uplisting-to-nyse-could-immediately-open-many-doors"">listed</a> on the NYSE earlier this year. The company's valuation has mainly been driven by data from its Phase 1 trial in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).</p><p>Some have questioned the results from the Phase 1 trial (i.e. the small patient population, no control group, comparison to historical data, and that it was conducted only at a one hospital), arguing that clinical results from the ongoing Phase 2 trial will not be near as impressive. It would be unrealistic to suggest that results from a larger, randomized, multicenter, ICT-107 trial would be comparable to a Phase 1 trial with only 16 patients. The question that investors should ask is whether or not ICT-107 needs to produce similar results in order to receive an FDA approval.</p><p><strong>Glioblastoma Multiforme</strong></p><p>GBM is the most dangerous and aggressive form of brain cancer. GBM patients typically have <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/805871-dr-keith-black-talks-ict-107?source=yahoo"">short-term life expectancies</a>; few will live to see three years after diagnosis. It is estimated that 11,000 of the 12,000 newly diagnosed GBM patients each year undergo surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy (Temodar) - the current standard of care (SOC). Unfortunately, the cancer inevitably returns within a year after treatment.</p><p><strong>Current Treatments</strong></p><p>In 2005, Merck's (MRK) chemotherapy agent, Temodar, was approved to treat newly diagnosed GBM patients. A randomized, Phase 3 clinical study <a href=""http://smithonstocks.com/component/content/article/3/270-northwest-biotherapeutics-dc-vax-cancer-vaccine-may-be-a-game-changer-in-cancer-therapy"">showed</a> that Temodar only added 2.5 months to the median survival of patients (Stupp et al. NEJM 2005). The chemotherapy agent reduced the size of tumors in over 50% of the patients tested and stabilized the size of the brain tumors in nearly 40% of the patients. However, tumor size increased in 10% of those treated. Despite the fact that Temodar only added 2.5 months to survival and showed no consistency regarding progression of the disease, it still received FDA approval.</p><p>Genentech's (RHHBY.PK) Avastin was <a href=""http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/news/News/avastin-approved-for-glioblastoma"">granted</a> accelerated approval in 2009 for the treatment of GBM patients who have had their cancers come back. The FDA approval was based on results from two open-label, Phase 2 studies (Friedman et al, JCO 2009 and Kreisl et al, JCO 2009). Twenty-six percent of patients who received Avastin saw their tumors, with the effect lasting less than six months. However, neither study showed whether or not Avastin had any improvement on overall survival. The FDA still approved the treatment, even with severe adverse events (Grade 3 or 4) in about half the patients.</p><p>Here's the key take-away: the FDA approved both Avastin and Temodar despite little meaningful benefit to patients. So as you can see, the bar has been set pretty low for approval in terms of clinical effect for GBM treatments. The reason is because over the years, very few treatments have been proven to work in treating the disease. It is a vicious disease, and we have very few answers at the moment.</p><p>For newly diagnosed GBM patients treated with current SOC, median progression free survival is just 6.9 months, and median overall survival is 14.6 months. In other words, patients typically begin to see tumors recur after seven months, and live just over one year. This makes GBM one of the most deadly forms of cancer. Only 26.5% of newly diagnosed GBM patients live beyond 24 months, and just 16% of patients survive more than three years. So even if a patient is lucky enough to live two years, their chances of living much longer are relatively slim.</p><p><strong>ICT-107 Phase 1 Results</strong></p><p>Now that you understand the seriousness of GBM, let's incorporate ICT-107's Phase 1 results into the equation. In the company's most recent <a href=""http://www.imuc.com/imuc-05-31-2012"">update</a>, it announced that 8 of the original 16 patients are still alive after four years and that 6 of the 8 are showing no signs of disease progression. In addition, 3 patients have already lived past the five-year mark, and it is possible that some of the other patients could live to see five years as well.</p><p>As a person who follows the advancements in oncology, ICT-107's Phase 1 <a href=""http://www.imuc.com/imuc-05-31-2012"">results</a> are simply amazing; there is nothing else in development or on the market with similar results. The bears will once again point to the fact that the Phase 1 study has only 16 patients, but in my opinion, this makes the results even more impressive. The reason is because there are no good outcomes for GBM patients. In order to be diagnosed with the disease, a patient must have a Grade IV tumor, and there are no good Grade IV tumors. Therefore, I look at the clinical results of ICT-107 as a huge positive, with 6 patients still alive after four years, and with only 16 patients tested, which is consistent with standard of care based on 100 patients. Basically, ICT-107 only needed 16 patients to achieve similar results of 100 based on SOC. And IMUC's 16-patient trial achieved what neither Avastin nor Temodar could achieve. Therefore, in the ICT-107 Phase 2 trial, I have no reason to believe that it won't at least have 10 patients from 100 achieve similar results, or show significant improvements over SOC, and if so, it would be considered the most effective vaccine in the market.</p><p><strong>Potential</strong></p><p>IMUC has a lot of margin for error with the ICT-107 Phase 2 trial. There are three factors that suggest that ICT-107 will be successful: 1) GBM is a Stage IV form of brain cancer; therefore all of the original 16 patients were in serious condition; 2) 50% survival over four years far exceeds SOC, which is far less than 10%, meaning if only 20 patients of 100 meet this standard ICT-107 would still be twice as effective as SOC; and 3) all data is superior to current treatments with an average of 16.9 months of median progression free survival compared to just 6.9 months for historical SOC (leaving even more room for error on behalf of IMUC).</p><p>The bottom line is that if Temodar increased survival by just 2.5 months and was still approved, then ICT-107 could possibly be approved with similar survival benefit. Patients treated with ICT-107 in the Phase 1 study live 23.8 months longer compared to historical SOC. And what's even more encouraging for IMUC is that Temodar only <a href=""http://smithonstocks.com/component/content/article/3/196-initiation-of-coverage-of-immunocellular-therapeutics-imucob"">increased</a> survival by 17% over SOC, while ICT-107 more than 160%. Obviously, there are a lot of factors to determine whether or not a drug is approved, but my reasoning suggests that if a treatment which only increases survival by 2.5 months was approved, then it would be difficult for ICT-107 to not be approved, as we know that it does have some clinical effect on GBM, which will most likely far outweigh both Avastin and Temodar.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>How can investors buy IMUC shares after just 16 patients tested with ICT-107 in an uncontrolled, single-center study? The answer, and best defense, is to point to the lack of any truly effective treatment and any no good outcomes for GBM. Sometimes a clinical stage biotechnology company will cherry pick data and use patients with early stages of a disease to make results appear more encouraging. However, with GBM, it doesn't matter if it's 10, 20, 30, or 40 patients, the disease is extremely aggressive, and must surpass three other stages of brain cancer in order to be labeled as GBM, which is the most deadly form of brain cancer, and is a disease where life simply ends. And although ICT-107's Phase 2 results will not likely be as impressive as in Phase 1, investors should remember that it doesn't need to be as effective in order to eventually receive an approval from the FDA. Just look at the data for currently approved drugs, and you will see just how much room for error ICT-107 has in this Phase 2 trial. If results from the Phase 2 study are as good as the Phase 1 trial, I believe the approval of ICT-107 could be much <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/731511-new-legislation-speeds-up-fda-approval-process-for-immunocellular-therapeutics-and-other-innovating-therapies"">sooner than we anticipate.</a></p><p>The company has now <a href=""http://www.imuc.com/imuc-07-02-2012"">enrolled</a> about 213 patients for the Phase 2 study, at a rate that far exceeds past GBM trials, and we should see interim results in the first quarter of 2013, which could be a major catalyst for the stock if results are even remotely close to the Phase 1 data or if ICT-107 shows a significant improvement over SOC. Only time will tell, but at this point, it's worth watching, and with only a few short months till interim data, it is looking as though patients with this deadly disease may finally have hope of survival, rather than expensive treatments that only prolong the inevitable.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[IMUC]].</p>"
"308469","2011-11-16 16:10:18","3 Cancer Immunotherapy Biotechs With Catalysts For 2012","<p>With 2011 drawing to a close, biotech investors reflect on a year witnessing cataclysmic events such as the rise of Medivation (MDVN) from January&rsquo;s $14 a share market cap of $489 million to Tuesday&rsquo;s close of $41.65 and market cap of $1.45 billion as well as the demise of the mighty Dendreon (DNDN) falling from April&rsquo;s $43 a share with a market cap $6.55 billion to Tuesday&rsquo;s close of $7.21 with a market cap of $1.07 billion. Investing in the biotech industry has its rewards along with its risks. Entrances into MDVN or DNDN at the proper times along with wise exits would have reaped phenomenal rewards. However, gains would have been minimal for the former with devastating losses for the latter if long entrances and exits were improper.</p><p>Upcoming catalysts for three relatively unknown biotechs can lead to huge gains for investors with the savvy to open positions before trials complete and data are reported. Even though modest gains are possible and even likely for those awaiting late stage entry into the companies&rsquo; common stock, early entry before the attention of the masses could mean the difference between ten to fifty percent gains versus several hundred percent gains. Of the three biotechs, one is a recent and another an upcoming IPO for biotech companies with cancer drugs just beginning to garner the attention of investors. Although the medical community and regulatory agencies are familiar with these formerly private industry companies, they are currently well off the radar for the investment community. The three biotechs have novel approaches to attacking cancer and may help redefine how we approach cancer treatments in the future with immunotherapy approaches defining their platforms instead of the historical chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery that has defined the treatment protocol in the past.</p><p>With a market cap of about $41 million and currently trading in the $1.40&rsquo;s, ImmunoCellular Therapeutics (IMUC.OB) is an early stage biotech with a focus on the immunotherapy approach to fighting cancer. Its most advanced candidate is in Phase II trials and is termed ICT-107. It is a dendritic cell based cancer vaccine designed to fight cancer stem cells with the current indication targeting Glioblastoma multiforme, a common and aggressive form of brain cancer. The Phase I trial included sixteen newly diagnosed patients with Glioblastoma. Trial data indicated six out of sixteen patients treated with ICT-107 were disease-free after more than three years, with one of those patients remaining disease-free after almost five years (data is still be accumulated on the patient set). Median survival was increased almost two years (38.4 vs. 14.8 months) in patients treated with ICT-107 along with the standard of care relative to patients on the current standard of care of radiotherapy and Temozolomide only. The three-year survival rate was 55% for ICT-107 patients versus 16% for historical data. No treatment-related serious adverse events have been reported to date. </p><p>Updates on the original Phase I patients are still forthcoming and are likely to be the next catalyst for the company&rsquo;s common stock. However, investors will also be eyeing enrollment completion for the Phase II trial in Q2 2012 with interim data analysis in Q3 or Q4 2012. If the Phase II data yield comparable results to the Phase I trial, ImmunoCellular Therapeutics will instantly be thrown into the spotlight not only for its novel approach of attacking Glioblastoma via its cancer stem cells, but also ensuring progression free survival and overall survival in patients with GBM. Their novel dendritic cell based cancer vaccine approach attacking CSC&rsquo;s (for more information on cancer stem cells please see <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/306203-immunocellular-therapeutics-cancer-stem-cell-drug-garnering-much-attention"">this article</a>) will be further legitimized and likely used to target other types of cancers. CSC&rsquo;s have been identified in cancers of the brain, breast, colon, ovary, pancreas, prostate, melanoma and multiple myeloma and will all be viable possibilities for this platform. Not a &ldquo;one trick pony&rdquo;, ImmunoCellular is additionally working on other drugs with a dendritic cell vaccine targeting CSC&rsquo;s in ovarian cancer using ICT-140 with a likely Phase I study in 1H 2012 and ICT-121, an &ldquo;off-the-shelf&rdquo; cancer vaccine for recurrent GBM with a likely Phase I trial likely in 2012 as well. Success in any of these cancers would be tremendous for the company&rsquo;s product line as it expands, obtains partnership agreements and licensing or even becomes the target of Big Pharma looking to add a cancer vaccine division rather than creating a new one from scratch.</p><p>NewLink Genetics&rsquo; (NLNK) IPO on Friday, November 11th raised $43.4 million for the company and its advancing pipeline. Like ImmunoCellular, the company is primarily focused on immunotherapy treatment of cancers. Its lead product candidate is HyperAcute Pancreas cancer immunotherapy for surgically resected pancreas cancer that is well into a Phase III trial that is performed under the FDA&rsquo;s Special Protocol Assessment ((SPA)). The drug contains two non-patient specific cell lines engineered to express the enzyme a-Gal. The enzyme is not naturally present in the human pancreatic cancer cells, but the engineered cells do contain a similar molecular signature as the cancer cells. The company believes that the body will attack the engineered cells and by doing so will learn to fight the naturally occurring cancer cells found in the pancreas. The 70-patient Phase II trial met its primary endpoint with a median disease free survival of 14.2 months according to a recent <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1126234/000104746911008354/a2201690zs-1a.htm"">SEC filing</a>. A recent analysis of the secondary endpoint indicated a one-year overall survival of 86%. Additional analysis on a 26-patient set receiving high-dose HyperAcute Pancreas immunotherapy demonstrated a median disease-free survival of 15.3 months and a one-year survival of 96%. These data were astounding and are likely attracting the attention of the medical community and Big Pharma as the American Cancer Society stated in 2010 that the mortality rate for pancreas cancer is 96% with one-year survival rates of 24%. NewLink has also indicated a positive safety profile for the drug to date. </p><p>The Phase III trial is expected to fully enroll by 2013, however interim data is expected well before then. Investors are urged to watch this company closely as multiple catalysts are possible any of which could drive the share price tremendously. NewLink presented the Phase II data June 3-7 at ASCO 2011. Interim Phase III and follow up of the Phase II patient set could certainly be likely at <a href=""http://chicago2012.asco.org/"">ASCO 2012</a> on June 1-5. In addition to the HyperAcute Pancreas trials underway, the company and its collaborators have also completed enrollment in a Phase I/II trial for HyperAcute Lung for non-small cell lung cancer ((NSCLC)) and a Phase II trial of HyperAcute Melanoma for Melanoma. In the Phase II arm of the HyperAcute Lung trial, interim analysis in December 2010 indicated median overall survival of 11.3 months and a one-year survival rate of 46%. According to the company, comparable precedent clinical trials of similar patients would have indicated a median overall survival of approximately 8 months. The company anticipates initiating a Phase IIB/III clinical trial in advanced NSCLC patients in the first half of 2012 and completing the first interim analysis in 2013. NewLink anticipates announcing their results from the HyperAcute Melanoma trial in the second half of 2011. The Phase IIB clinical trial in melanoma would likely initiate in 1H 2012. NewLink Genetics is a company for biotech investors to be watching 4Q 2011, 2012 and 2013 with multiple price-per-share-moving catalysts ensuing. Additional positive data from any of these three trials will legitimize the company&rsquo;s HyperAcute Immunotherapy pipeline and drive the company&rsquo;s value. More information on the HyperAcute platform and its working mechanisms is on the <a href=""http://www.linkp.com/programs/hyperacute-immunotherapies.html"">company website</a>.</p><p>The third company to key in on should be Verastem, Incorporated which is planning an IPO according to a <a href=""http://www.verastem.com/announcements/article.aspx?id=14"">press release</a> on November 3rd. A timeframe or pricing has not been revealed yet, but this company should provide investors with multiple catalysts as it completes its IPO and starts its publicly traded future. Much like ImmunoCellular&rsquo;s ICT-107, Verastem&rsquo;s pipeline focuses on fighting cancer through cancer stem cells. Although still in pre-clinical development, investors, potential partners and even merger/acquisition candidates will be watching the company closely to ascertain what types of positions they should take in this fledging but exciting biotech. </p><p>Dr. Christoph Westphal is the company&rsquo;s CEO/Chairman and Verastem&rsquo;s largest shareholder with 20% ownership.   He was also CEO and founder of Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in 2008 for $720 million and cofounder/CEO of Alnylam (ALNY) of which Novartis AG (NVS) is 13.1% owner per the <a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=148005&amp;p=irol-ownershipSummary"">company&rsquo;s website</a>. Former Genzyme Corporation&rsquo;s long-time CEO <a href=""http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110613006697/en/Henri-Termeer-Joins-Verastem-Board-Directors"">Henri Termeer</a> sits on Verastem&rsquo;s&rsquo; board of directors and provides invaluable insight and influence in the industry. Upon joining the board he was quoted as stating &ldquo;I am delighted to join Verastem&rsquo;s Board of Directors and to work closely with this world-class scientific and entrepreneurial team. I believe Verastem's breakthrough work targeting cancer stem cells with novel small molecule drugs has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of breast and other major cancers.&rdquo; Verastem&rsquo;s future looks bright with a novel pipeline and phenomenal leadership.</p><p>At a time when many biotechs and other privately owned companies are wary of the IPO process with economic uncertainty dominating the headlines, novel cancer immunotherapy companies are confident enough in their platforms and potential marketability to assure investors of their successful and profitable futures as demonstrated by these latter two IPO&rsquo;s. 2012 will likely be an exciting and potentially profitable year for those taking early, wise and justifiable positions in ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, NewLink Genetics and Verastem, Incorporated common stock. Investors should always utilize risk assessment as they make entrances, increase and reduce positions and interpret data and company financials. These three companies are in different stages of pipeline development and are at different levels of public maturity. Together, they represent good investment diversity for the immunotherapeutic approach to attacking one of man&rsquo;s most deadly enemies.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.</p>"
"871271","2012-09-17 12:07:32","Isotope Manufacturing Companies Step Up As Aging Nuclear Reactors And Government Policies Threaten Nuclear Medicine","<p>When most hear the words &quot;nuclear reactor,&quot; they think about bombs, electric power, and an occasional radioactive monster terrorizing Tokyo. However, there is an entire field of nuclear medicine that relies on nuclear reactors to produce isotopes for medical use. <a href=""http://www.nordion.com/our_products/medical_isotopes_molybdenum99.asp"">Technetium-99m</a> (Tc-99m) is the most widely used isotope in nuclear medicine with some 30 million procedures a year. It is utilized in 80% of all nuclear medicine procedures worldwide to diagnose and treat patients with such issues as heart disease and cancer. Nuclear medicine is big business: 18 million medical procedures in the U.S. use medical isotopes, while in Europe the number is 10 million; and those numbers are expected to grow at 10% annually. Over 10,000 hospitals worldwide use radioisotopes in medicine, and about 90% of the procedures are for diagnostics. Isotopes are useful in diagnostic tests because they emit easy-to-detect gamma rays, and they break down very quickly usually giving only a small dose of radiation to the patient.</p><p>The current supply of the much needed isotopes used in nuclear medicine is being threatened, not just by aging and decaying nuclear reactors, but by governments insisting that medical isotopes no longer be developed with bomb-grade highly enriched uranium ((HEU)). Instead, the supply must be produced with low-grade enriched uranium ((LEU)). Tc-99m's production requires another isotope, molybdenum-99 (Mo-99). Mo-99 is now made in nuclear reactors using HEU. In June, the Obama administration made it clear that it is more than simply encouraging reliable supplies of medical grade isotopes produced without HEU by endorsing amendment S. 99 of the American Medical Isotopes Production Act of 2011, passed by the U.S. Senate. The <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/07/fact-sheet-encouraging-reliable-supplies-molybdenum-99-produced-without-"">amendment s</a> objectives were to minimize global commerce in HEU in order to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation -- and to ensure a reliable supply of medical radio-isotopes derived from Mo-99 by fostering domestic production without HEU. Domestic supply of isotopes is a growing problem considering that 90% of all the medical isotopes used in the USA are imported from five aging nuclear reactors, 43 to 52 years old, with two of them -- the Osiris reactor in Saclay, France, due to shut down in 2015, and Canada's NRU reactor-- scheduled to be shut down by 2016. S. 99 opens opportunities for U.S. companies to develop methods to produce Mo-99 in the USA. In the meantime, the Mo-99 shortage continues to be a concern.</p><p>General Electric (GE) seemed to have the answer to the Mo-99 shortage. In early 2010, GE came up with a solution that would utilize two of its previously built <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/science/26nuke.html?scp=5%26sq=wald%20medical%20isotope%20chalk%26st=cse"">reactors</a>. These reactors have tiny openings at the bottom, used for technicians to insert an instrument that counts neutrons, the sub-atomic particles that sustain a nuclear chain-reaction. GE and its partner, Hatachi (HTHIY), would place the isotope, molybdenum-98 (Mo-98), on the mechanism that usually holds the neutron-measuring instrument. Some of the Mo-98 would pick up an extra neutron and become Mo-99. &quot;We've done this on a lab scale basis,&quot; said Kevin Walsh, the chief executive of Global Nuclear Fuel, a joint venture of GE, Hitachi, and Toshiba (TOSBF.PK). Unfortunately, earlier this year GE abandoned the project citing it was not commercially viable. Kevin Walsh, a nuclear-fuel executive at General Electric, said that the company would finish developing the system if the economics improved, but that for now, &quot;We've put all the engineering aside.&quot; In a statement, GE noted that while the company was confident that &quot;large quantities of molybdenum-99 could safely be produced&quot; in one of their reactors, financial projections &quot;do not support the remaining costs.&quot;</p><p>That has not stopped other companies, big and small, from looking for ways to produce Mo-99 using low- grade uranium and other means. In January 2009, Covidien (COV), a healthcare giant from Dublin, Ireland, teamed up with Babcock &amp; Wilcox (BWC), a Charlotte, NC-based nuclear component and service provider, in developing tiny new <a href=""http://investor.covidien.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=207592%26p=irol-newsArticle%26id=1538002"">reactors</a> that would have roughly one ten-thousandth the power output of a commercial reactor and would run on uranium in a liquid form. The uranium would be the fuel providing the neutrons and the target of the fission process to produce Mo-99. The reactor would be shut down periodically, and the molybdenum isotope filtered out of it. The unused uranium would go back into the reactor via a recycling process that would minimize waste. The joint effort combines Covidien's radiopharmaceutical production and regulatory approvals with Babcock &amp; Wilcox's patented liquid phase nuclear know-how. Covidien also has plans for converting its Mo-99 processing facility, based in Petten, Holland, to facilitate use of LEU unsuitable for bombs. However, the company states it is years away from completion, so HEU is still required to produce the Mo-99 isotopes.</p><p>Year to date, Covidien's stock has had an excellent run-up over 25%. In the past month, the stock seems to be taking a breather, and has traded in a narrow range just shy of its 52-week high of $57.31. This $27.36 billion market cap seems to be back in prominence in the healthcare industry. Even if its partnership with Babcock &amp; Wilcox turns unfruitful in developing Mo-99, Covidien is well-diversified as a leading global healthcare company with a history of developing high-quality products in a cost-effective manner. One example is its new iDrive Ultra powered stapling system -- a first of its kind. It is a fully powered, battery-operated, reusable endoscopic stapler used during laparoscopic and open surgeries.</p><p>The downturn in the U.S. and European economy may put pricing pressures on the company, which could slow down the stock's growth. Covidien has a quarterly dividend of $0.225 per share. <a href=""http://www.dailypolitical.com/finance/stock-market/covidien-plc-stock-rating-reaffirmed-by-barclays-capital-cov.htm"">Analysts</a> at Jefferies Group reiterated a &quot;buy&quot; rating, while Zacks has a target price of $59.00 with a &quot;neutral&quot; rating. This is a stock to keep an eye on and, if it dips, it might be a good time to buy.</p><p>Advanced Medical Isotope Corporation (ADMD.OB), a nano-cap company from Kennewick, WA, may be in an excellent position to be one of the companies to take the lead on Mo-99 production as it is actively becoming one of the few companies producing medical isotopes in the USA. In May 2010, ADMD entered into a <a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/e/120814/admd10-q.html"">License Agreement</a> for the Patent Rights in the area of radioisotope production using electron beam accelerators for creating short lived radioisotopes, such as Mo-99 and Tc-99m, with the University of Missouri. ADMD is not relying on Mo-99 production alone; it is hedging its bet with a business model that has a three-prong approach. The company is actively producing short-lived and stable isotopes for PET procedures with a PULSAR Isotope Production system, the first compact <a href=""http://blog.qualitystocks.net/qualitystocks-partner-stockguru/stockguru-news-advanced-medical-isotope-corporation-installs-first-compact-linear-accelerator-for-isotope-production-in-north-america/"">linear accelerator</a> ((LINAC)) in North America designed for the production of medical isotopes used in Positron Emission Tomography ((PET)) imaging. PULSAR sets a new standard for production of PET and other isotopes using proton beams. It is a more compact and a reliable alternative to cyclotrons, incorporating proven compact accelerator technology integrated with high production yield targets and advanced chemistry process units. Technology advances in medical isotope manufacturing allow ADMD to site build, and operate the LINAC isotope production centers at significantly lower costs than traditional cyclotron accelerators. This affords ADMD substantial cost reductions and enables the company to generate a broad product line.</p><p>William J. Stokes, CEO of ADMD, <a href=""http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/news.html?d=137533"">stated</a> <em>&quot;Our goal is to empower physicians, medical researchers, and biotechnology companies by providing them with essential medical isotopes that heretofore have not been feasible or economical, in an effort to detect and cure human disease&hellip; With this compact linear accelerator (LINAC), the first of its kind in North America designed specifically for the production of PET isotopes such as fluorine-18, nitrogen-13, carbon-11, and oxygen-15, our team will also be able to produce other highly desired longer-lived isotopes, including actinium-225, iodine-123, and indium-111 for diagnostic as well as therapeutic applications.&quot;</em> Being able to produce and deliver these isotopes, which are a billion dollar market, would provide a great opportunity for ADMD to position itself to profit as a major supplier of these, and other, isotopes. ADMD is currently shipping stable isotopes worldwide.</p><p>The third prong in its three-prong business model is its licensing agreement with Battelle Memorial Institute regarding its radiogel technology. Radiogel is a biodegradable polymer that delivers, not with a catheter but with an injection, yttrium-90 (Y-90) microspheres directly into the tumor killing the cancer cells. The polymer is a liquid when first injected to the targeted cancer site; but the liquid warms quickly to the body temperature and turns into a gel where the doctor injects it. The gel traps the yttrium-90 microspheres in place as the high energy beta particles irradiate cancer cells in the target mass. What makes radiogel stand out from other treatments is that little of the radiation reaches nearby healthy tissue, thus maximizing the overall radiation dose to cancer cells while minimizing exposure to nearby normal tissues. Because it can be administered through the skin or during surgery, the procedure has the ability to be delivered to solid tumors that cannot be removed safely. Radiogel appears to have numerous applications, including cancers of the liver, brain, head and neck, kidney and pancreas. It is also showing promise for eye tumors.</p><p>ADMD is a nano-cap company with a $19.6 million market capitalization at the time of this composition. It is trading at about $0.23 per share and has had an excellent YTD run of over 160%. There may be good reason for the run up; it appears ADMD continues to position itself with its isotope lines along with its radiogel technology to be the U.S. leader in isotope production and delivery. On Sept 11, ADMD bolstered its board by announcing it had has added <a href=""http://www.nasdaq.com/article/advanced-medical-isotope-corporation-announces-board-of-directors-appointment-20120911-00203"">Thomas J. Clement</a>, one of the region's top medical device entrepreneurs, to the Board of Directors. Clement has over 30 years experience in product development engineering, engineering management, and senior management. He was a founding employee of Heart Technology, which grew to more than $100 million in revenue, and was later acquired by Boston Scientific. The market took the news positively as the stock rose 30%. However, just like so many small companies, there are questions and risks. Time will tell if ADMD and its staff can bring its products to the next level. Chances are, until another company actually implements a method of manufacturing Mo-99 with LEUs, and given that age of the 5 nuclear reactors, ADMD might just be in the right place at the right time with the right product. However, caution must be exercised: ADMD is an interesting and risky investment. One must remember that it has been shown time and time again when it comes to nano or micro-cap companies, one small piece of news can send a tiny company's stock in either direction. ADMD has shown that with its 30% run up on Sept 12. The question is, are there more isotopes in ADMD's tank to power an even larger run? It appears so as the company continues to grow and diversify. However, the company is a quasi-development phase entity although it does appear to have accelerated a bit in the last few months. Investors are advised to consider the risks and be willing to accept or anticipate the volatility in this promising investment.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Although they have a long way to go to catch up with the revenue generating (and therefore networking capability) divisions of NeoStem, they are advancing with strong science and $43 million in cash at the end of 2011. Advanced Cell Technology's single-blastomere technology of extracting stem cells from embryonic stem cells without the destruction of the embryos has huge implications if it can be fully proven with no effects on developing fetuses (so far so good per published reports). The company recently announced intentions of uplisting to the NASDAQ stock exchange, but this does require a reverse split in order to be eligible for the uplisting. Shareholders were to vote on a 1:20 to 1:80 reverse split on April 26, so new potential investors should consider this when making their investment decisions. Cytori Therapeutics has applied for the CE Mark for its Celution System in no-option chronic myocardial ischemia. The company is expecting to hear a decision from the regulatory body in 1H 2012.

"979611","2012-11-05 16:01:23","Investments In The Fight Against Cancer: The Analysts' Choices","<p>Sadly, <a href=""http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH/WSIHW000/8096/24516/362246.html?d=dmtContent"">cancer</a> is the second leading cause of death in the U.S., behind heart disease. Worldwide, approximately <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/Features/WorldCancerDay/index.html"">12.7 million</a> people will be diagnosed with cancer this year, and roughly 7.6 million people will die from the disease. The global burden of cancer continues to increase largely due to the aging population, the growth of the world population, and an increase of a cancer-causing lifestyle, such as smoking, especially in economically developing countries. Today, more people die from cancer than from AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis combined. The World Health Organization projects the global number of deaths from cancer will increase nearly 80% by 2030, with most occurring in low and middle-income countries.</p><p>Due to the lack of products that can safely treat cancer, pharmaceutical manufacturers have enjoyed <a href=""http://www.trefis.com/company?hm=RHHBY.trefis%26"">high profits</a> from drugs that fight the disease; and according to <a href=""http://www.trefis.com/company?hm=RHHBY.trefis&amp;#"">Trefis.com</a>, pricing of cancer drugs has not yet met its ceiling. This means higher prices and higher profits for investors. Because of the lack of safe cancer treatments, cancer companies, large and small, are working diligently to produce the next blockbuster cancer drug. Following are three pharmaceuticals that represent good investment potential for long-term positions. These companies are in various stages of drug development with mixed financials, differing levels of risk and mixed upside potential.</p><p><strong>Roche Holdings (RHHBY.OB)</strong> based in Basel, Switzerland, with its pharmaceuticals subsidiaries Genentech in the U.S. and Chugai in Japan, is the largest manufacturer of cancer-fighting drugs, and has the highest market share in the global oncology market. Roche had 5 of the top 10 selling cancer drugs of 2011 on the market, including its non-Hodgkin lymphoma drug, Rituxan/MabThera, with <a href=""http://www.fiercepharma.com/special-reports/top-10-best-selling-cancer-drugs/rituxan-3-billion"">$3 billion</a> in worldwide sales, Avastin, its colorectal cancer drug with $2.5 billion in sales, Herceptin, its Metastatic HER2 + breast cancer drug with sales of $1.66 billion, Xeloda, another colorectal cancer drug with $6.47 million in sales, and Tarceva, its lung cancer drug with $5.64 million in sales. Several of these drugs have found additional indications beyond the one cancer they were initially manufactured to fight, including 6 additional indications in the oncology segment relating to Avastin, Herceptin, Tarceva, and MabThera/Rituxan that Roche is planning to file for approval in 2012. The company has a pipeline of cancer-fighting drugs and expects results from 19 late-stage clinical trials over the next 18 months.</p><p>Roche has seen a few setbacks recently. Its promising cardiovascular drug, <a href=""http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Abstract/2012/26040/Phase_III_Trial_of_Dalcetrapib__Discontinued_Due.6.aspx"">dalcetrapib</a>, was discontinued after it failed in its Phase III trials to significantly boost good ((HDL)) cholesterol. Its third best-selling drug, Herceptin, which treats 25-30% of breast cancer patients who have tumors that generate HER-2 positive proteins, has come under fire because of results of two conflicting studies examining how long patients should use the drug. The studies, one conducted by Roche called <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/09/05/roche-eyes-new-drugs-as-herceptin-faces-challenge/"">HERA</a>, looked at the benefits of using Herceptin over 2 years as opposed to the standard 1 year. The second, an opposing French study called PHARE, is looking at whether patients receive the same benefit from using Herceptin for only 6 months as opposed to a full year. If the French PHARE study shows that there are no real benefits to using the drug beyond 6 months (and given the fact that the austerity-hit European healthcare systems are cutting back the use of the drug substantially, according to Kepler Capital Markets analyst, Fabian Wenner), PHARE has the potential to wipe $1.5 billion off Herceptin's revenue in the medium-term, and could send the stock down some 5-10%. Mr. Wenner added that Herceptin's adverse side effects on the heart could also hinder against longer use.</p><p>To add to Roche's setbacks, the <a href=""http://www.fiercepharma.com/tags/european-medicines-agency"">European Medicines Agency</a> ((EMA)) says it has started an &quot;infringement procedure&quot; to probe allegations that Roche dragged its feet on reporting some 80,000 adverse-event reports including potential side effects on a number of its drugs, which happen to be some of its top sellers: Avastin, Tarceva, Herceptin, and Tamiflu, along with the anti-HIV drugs Viracept and Invirase. If the EMA finds that Roche fell short of its obligations, the company could be fined by the European Commission up to 5 % of its annual sales in Europe.</p><p>Roche, with a market cap of $167.58 billion, is down slightly over the past few days of trading, and is currently at $48.74 per share, just shy of its 52-week high of $50.82. Its PE ratio of 18.33 is just slightly above the major drug manufacturer's sector average of 17.2, while its dividend yield of $3.78 is just slightly above its sector average of $3.68. Surprisingly Roche has felt little effect with a rash of negative news that has recently come out and with the market sell-off over the past few trading days. Perhaps mitigating the negative news is that the company beat analyst estimates by reporting a <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-16/roche-third-quarter-revenue-advances-15-percent-as-dollar-strengthens"">15%</a> increase in third-quarter sales. The company is still a solid company with a good dividend; however, given the current problems and the high stock price, this company looks like a good &quot;<em>hold&quot;</em> and perhaps a &quot;<em>buy&quot;</em> on the dips.</p><p><strong>Galena Biopharma (GALE)</strong>, a $135.7 million market cap company based in Lake Oswego, OR, has seen its stock rise over 300% YTD, mostly due to the positive news on its breast cancer drug, <a href=""http://www.galenabiopharma.com/pipeline"">NeuVax</a>; and according to new analysts' reports, the upward trend should continue. Analysts at <a href=""http://www.dailypolitical.com/finance/stock-market/mlv-capital-starts-stock-coverage-on-galena-biopharma-gale.htm"">MLV Capital</a> initiated coverage recently, and set a &quot;<em>buy</em>&quot; rating and a $6.00 price target on the stock. <a href=""http://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/12/10/3027025/update-mcnicoll-lewis-vlak-initiates-galena-biopharma-at"">McNicoll Lewis Vlak</a> initiated coverage with a 1-year target price of $6.00 per share based on NeuVax's ongoing Phase III trial, and the belief that the drug will be able to prolong the lives of breast cancer patients who had their disease caught at an early stage. Separately, analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated a &quot;<em>buy</em>&quot; rating in a research note to investors on Wednesday, with a $4.00 target price for the stock.</p><p>The reason the analysts are giving positive ratings to Galena is that NeuVax has entered a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Special Protocol Assessment for its Phase III clinical trials in an adjuvant setting with women with HER2 that are not eligible for Roche's Herceptin. That is important because Herceptin is given to HER2-positive breast cancer patients, which only account for 25% of patients. NeuVax, if found effective, will address the remaining 75%: the patients who are HER2-negative. NeuVax is an E75 peptide derived from HER2 combined with the immune adjuvant granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In layman's terms, <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/breast-cancer/AN00495"">HER2</a> promotes the growth of breast cancer cells. T cells are a type of white blood cell that help fight off harmful substances in the body, like cancer cells. NeuVax stimulates the CD8+ T cells to target cells that show any level of HER2. Consider the fact that Herceptin sales are, as noted earlier, $1.66 billion annually. It is possible that if NeuVax, which has the potential of treating 50% more patients than Herceptin, can indeed treat low to intermediate HER2-negative patients, it too may be at least as financially successful as Herceptin. Earlier this year Galena received its U.S. patent for NeuVax, removing concerns of another company replicating its technology. Thus, the company will have a number of years to benefit from the low-cost, high-profit drug.</p><p>Galena also has another drug in preclinical trials, <a href=""http://www.galenabiopharma.com/pipeline"">Folate Binding Protein-E39</a> ((FBP)), that began enrollment in February of this year for a Phase I/II trial to target ovarian and endometrial cancers. Ovarian cancer occurs in over 22,000 patients per year in the U.S., and due to the lack of specific symptoms, the majority of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed at later stages of the disease; thus, it is the most lethal gynecologic cancer. Though ovarian cancer is not as prevalent as breast cancer, the number of patients that die from ovarian cancer is nearly 50% that of breast cancer patients.</p><p>Galena, with its stock trading around $2.15 per share, continues to add clinical operation sites in Europe and Asia. President and CEO, Mark Ahn, plans to add more staff (for a total of 50), which would make it a decent-sized biotechnology company. Mr. Ahn commented on the size of biotech and how smaller companies are making giant strides: &quot;Where once drug research was limited to the larger firms, now most innovations are coming from small companies such as Galena.&quot; Though Galena shows no profits as of yet, this company should be valued (as many development-phase biopharmaceutical companies) on perceived future earnings based on news, good or bad. If NeuVax trials continue to show the drug is even moderately successful, it could prove to be a new powerhouse for Galena in the breast cancer drug market. Considering its size, Galena could be primed for a buyout by one of the major drug manufacturers who would profit from NeuVax in its portfolio. I see Galena Biopharma a &quot;<em>strong buy&quot;</em> at current levels.</p><p><a href=""http://www.syntapharma.com/"">Synta Pharmaceuticals</a> <strong>(SNTA)</strong>, a biopharmaceutical company with a market cap of $479 million, has also had positive analysts' coverage. The <a href=""http://zolmax.com/synta-pharmaceuticals-corp-given-new-22-00-price-target-at-jefferies-group-snta/2916098/"">Jefferies Group</a>, which has a &quot;<em>buy</em>&quot; rating on the stock, raised its target price from $15.00 to $22.00 in a research report sent to investors earlier this month. This occurred after the company announced its results from the interim analysis of the Phase IIb portion of the <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/SNTA.O/key-developments/article/2615457"">GALAXY trial</a>, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of its lead Hsp90 inhibitor, ganetespib, as second-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The results indicated good tolerability for the combination of ganetespib ((G)) and docetaxel ((D)), as well as meaningful improvements in overall survival in adenocarcinoma patients receiving docetaxel plus ganetespib compared to those receiving docetaxel alone (the control). The Jefferies Group was encouraged that the overall survival data continued to show a strong favorable trend; the analyst commented, &quot;We spoke at length with three GALAXY investigators who were bullish on the data and the safety profile. Although more maturity of data is needed for confirmation, we believe that strong ganetespib activity has been demonstrated and would be buyers of the stock.&quot;</p><p>Synta develops drugs to extend the lives and enhance the quality of life for cancer patients. Synta's stock is up 140% over the past year, and almost 75% YTD. At $8.09, it is nearing its 52-week high of $9.85 after bouncing off its May lows of $3.53. Given the positive data from the Galaxy trial, and the coverage from the Jefferies Group, even if the stock does not reach the target price, there is still plenty of upside potential.</p><p>As noted earlier, pharmaceutical manufacturers have enjoyed premium-pricing from drugs that fight cancer due to the large unmet need in the healthcare sector. Many times, drugs that look promising in earlier phases disappoint in later phases as more time has passed and more patients are evaluated. That is why when a new cancer drug looks promising in later trials, analysts take note. However, caution is advised: biopharmaceutical stocks can be volatile, offer huge upside potential and corresponding downside risks. Presented are three diverse companies targeting one of man's biggest killers. The three presented companies offer good current-level entries for various levels of risk, income, clinical development and indications targeted. Interested investors are advised to perform additional research to ascertain which, if any, of these fit their investment criteria.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

"927111","2012-10-16 13:26:22","3 Agriculture Stocks To Consider For Exposure To Stevia","<p>Ag Alert, which is the weekly newspaper of the California Farm Bureau Federation, recently <a href=""http://www.steviafirst.com/industry_news/news_article/2012/06/farmers-and-rms-ramp-up-to-expand-stevia-plantings"">published an article</a> on a number of different aspects of the Stevia industry and its growing importance in California.</p><p>Stevia is a member of the sunflower family. The plant is originally native to Paraguay and has been used as a natural sweetener in its raw unprocessed form for many years. The plant's leaves contain compounds that can be up to 400 times sweeter than sugar. Stevia <a href=""http://www.steviafirst.com/stevia/about-stevia"">has zero calories</a>, and tests have shown that the principal sweetener, extract Reb A, has no effect on blood glucose or insulin levels. Japan has been using Stevia extracts for more than three decades, and both the FDA and the European Food Safety Agency have approved the use of Reb A.</p><p>Today, stevia is grown primarily in China, which has 50,000 acres under production, but many experts believe that California has the potential to become the stevia growing capital of the world. Food economists believe that the global stevia market could grow from about $1 billion to about $10 billion by 201 while also gaining market share in the global sweetener market, which is estimated at around $60 billion. The World Health Organization also believes that stevia could eventually account for 20% to 30% of all dietary sweeteners used. One of the companies that is featured in Ag Alert's article is <strong>Stevia First (STVF.OB)</strong>.</p><p>In order to take full advantage of the coming explosion in stevia demand, Stevia First <a href=""http://www.steviafirst.com/"">intends</a> to create a &quot;<span>first of its kind&quot;</span> vertically integrated stevia business in North America. The company has placed itself in California's Central Valley, one of the most productive and innovative agricultural regions in the world. Stevia First intends to draw on the expertise of researchers and growers there. The company will utilize fermentation-based production as well as advanced plant breeding and harvesting techniques to control the quality of production from start to finish. In doing this, Stevia First will establish a huge source of affordable stevia products for customers. Research and development will <a href=""http://www.steviafirst.com/about-us/our-story"">focus</a> on high-value objectives, including fermentation-based stevia production methods, which could reduce the need for stevia leaf production. The company also aims to develop advanced varieties of the stevia plant, whose leaves can provide safe, natural, zero-calorie extracts to be used as sweeteners.</p><p>As far as the <a href=""http://www.steviafirst.com/about-us/our-product-focus"">product focus</a> is concerned, Stevia First initially plans to produce stevia leaves and extracts for processors and refiners who will then further process the extract for use by consumers and beverage makers. The company has identified sources such as OEM suppliers and food technologists who will create their own branded product lines (tabletop sweeteners and nutritional enhancers).The best tasting steviol glycloside formula is Reb A, which can be 200 to 400 times sweeter than sugar. Reb A contains zero calories and does not elicit a glycemic response, which makes it safe for diabetics to use. It is also non-cariogenic, which means that teeth will not be damaged. It is heat and pH stable, and can be used in place of sugar in most instances.</p><p>Stevia First has taken concrete steps to implement its business plan by <a href=""http://www.steviafirst.com/news/news_releases/2012/04/stevia-first-corp.-leases-1000-acres-for-base-of-commercial-stevia-operations-in-californias-central-valley"">leasing 1,000 acres of land</a> in California's Central Valley. The strategy of leasing rather than buying will help to control capital expenditure. Research and manufacturing facilities are also being developed. Stevia First is researching different methods of stevia production, including both farm-based stevia production and fermentation-based stevia production. The company expects to develop proprietary stevia plants over the next two or three years by which time it will be ready to commence commercial scale production. The company has signed an agreement to license intellectual property from Vineland Research and Innovation Centre, which is a leading Canadian-based company. The license includes compositions and methods for preparing steviol glycosides and steviol through fermentation based processes. A separate consulting contract will enable the two companies to work jointly on developing stevia.</p><p>The company's <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/STVF%3aUS/cash-flow"">financials</a> for the second quarter of 2012 show no revenue and a loss attributable to common stockholders of $430,000. Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30th, 2012 stood at $920,000, and equity stood at $370,000, after accounting for accrued losses. Net cash generation for the quarter stood at $360,000, after accounting for cash from financing activities of $890,000. However, these figures are typical for this kind of early stage company. Stevia First has an impressive business model, and it has made the right moves so far in implementing its business plan. Stevia First is currently trading around $0.55, between a 52-week range of $0.23 and $3.58. If you believe in the enormous market potential of stevia, you should consider investing in Stevia First today.</p><p><strong>S&amp;W Seed (SANW)</strong> <a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sw-seed-harvesting-stevia-for-commercial-production-165404796.html"">was established in 1980</a> and is also headquartered in California's Central Valley. S&amp;W Seed Company is an established producer of warm climate, high yield alfalfa seed varieties, including seeds that can flourish in poor, saline soils. The company's products have been established over years of university-sponsored trials. The company also offers seed cleaning and processing at its 40-acre facility in Five Points, California, and has recently launched a business expansion focused on mass producing stevia leaves in the U.S. This is in response to growing global demand for the natural zero calorie sweetener from the food and beverage industry.</p><p>For the <a href=""http://www.seedquest.com/news.php?type=news%26id_article=30128%26id_region=%26id_category=37%26id_crop="">fiscal year ended June 30th, 2012</a>, S&amp;W Seed reported an increase in revenues of 289% to $14.1 million, up from $3.6 million in 2011. Seed and crop revenues increased 398% to $13.3 million, compared to $2.7 million on a year-on-year basis. EBITDA was $868,000 for the year, an improvement of $2.1 million, compared to a loss in the previous year. Basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $0.06, versus a loss of ($0.14) per share in 2011. A write down of $277,000, related to lower than anticipated yields on the company's non-core and non-recurring wheat and triticale crops, was included in the results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012. This was primarily used for land reclamation to prepare for alfalfa seed production. Excluding the effect of this one-time loss, net income for fiscal year 2012 would have been $556,000, or EPS of $0.09 per basic and diluted share. Dedicated alfalfa seed acreage for the harvest in the fall of 2012 increased by 94% to over 4,600 acres, while dedicated stevia acreage expanded to more than 250 acres, compared to 114 acres in 2011.</p><p>S&amp;W Seed successfully completed a $5.5 million public offering in May 2012 to generate funding in order to acquire additional farmland to expand alfalfa seed production. S&amp;W Seed has also raised $3.5 million in a private placement transaction, in which it sold 600,000 shares of restricted common stock at $5.85 per share. Additionally, S&amp;W Seed was able to achieve an increase in a line of credit with Wells Fargo to $7.5 million, which remains untapped, to help facilitate its growth plans. The company is currently in a comfortable financial position.</p><p>S&amp;W Seed Company has <a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sw-seed-harvesting-stevia-for-commercial-production-165404796.html"">commenced</a> the commercial harvest of stevia in August 2012, and expects to complete at least one more harvest by the end of this year. This is the second year in which the company has produced stevia leaves from its 114 acre field in Chowchilla, California. After the harvest, the stevia leaf will be dried and prepared for shipment at the company's processing facility in Five Points, California. The company has recently planted a second generation field of approximately 150 additional acres, utilizing plant varieties that it believes may be superior to those of the first generation planting on the Chowchilla field.</p><p>In 2010, S&amp;W Seed <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/897481-purecircle-could-need-more-production-to-meet-stevia-demand"">entered</a> into a five-year agreement with <strong>PureCircle (PCRTF.PK)</strong> to sell the s<span>tevia</span> that it grows for further processing and refining. PureCircle, which is based in Malaysia, is one of the world's leading producers of high purity s<span>tevia</span> ingredients for the global food and beverage industry. As the driving force behind moving s<span>tevia</span> from niche to mainstream global acceptance, S&amp;W Seed is advancing sweeteners for manufacturers as well as consumers. S&amp;W Seed has a substantial market share (90% by some estimates) in the supply of stevia to the U.S., excluding tabletop sweeteners. S&amp;W Seed has demonstrated that it is possible to grow stevia successfully in the U.S. and California in particular, but it is clear that strong market demand for stevia will require large production capacity in the U.S.</p><p>Though S&amp;W Seed generates revenues and has made a profit in the last fiscal year, there are several key points potential investors should keep in mind. Stevia cultivation has successfully commenced, but the company still has to establish itself as a reliable and consistent stevia producer. The company will probably require more acreage in order to be commercially viable. The company's acquisition of Imperial Valley Seeds for $6 million is somewhat troubling. This is a big risk for such a small company, and it is going to have a big job on its hands of digesting the acquisition and harnessing the synergies. Moreover, Imperial is a producer of alfalfa seeds, and brings nothing to the table when it comes to the stevia business. S&amp;W Seed is currently trading around $7.91 per share, between a 52-week range of $3.95 and $8. I believe investors should watch S&amp;W Seed closely as more information about the Imperial acquisition comes out.</p><p><strong>Ingredion (INGR)</strong> is a <a href=""http://www.ingredion.com/about-us/overview/"">new name</a> for Corn Products International. The name was changed to better reflect the ingredients that the company supplies and the markets that it serves. In its sweetener range of products, Ingredion sells stevia-based sweeteners under the brand name Enliten, though this is not a major product for the company. Based in the Chicago suburb of Westchester, Illinois, Ingredion is a leading provider of ingredient solutions. The company turns raw materials like corn, tapioca and wheat into a number of ingredients catering to the food and beverages industry. The company's products also supply the brewing and pharmaceuticals industries. Ingredion has more than 10,000 employees serving customers in 60 different markets in 40 countries. The company's starches, sweeteners, texturants and nutritionals are used by its clients as sweeteners and adhesives.</p><p>Ingredion <a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=77278%26p=irol-newsArticle%26ID=1720144%26highlight="">reported</a> strong results for the second quarter of 2012. Second quarter diluted EPS grew by 39% to $1.40 per share, compared to $1.01 per share year-on-year. This included a $0.16 per share benefit from the release of a Korean deferred tax valuation allowance, which was partially offset by $0.08 of restructuring and impairment charges and $0.01 of business integration costs. The second quarter of 2011 had included $0.07 of integration costs and $0.02 of restructuring charges. When these items are excluded, adjusted EPS grew 21% from $1.10 in the same quarter of the previous year to $1.33 this quarter. The estimated factors driving the increase in 2012 adjusted EPS were $0.25 from margin improvements, $0.03 from higher volumes, and $0.03 of normal operating items partially offset by $0.08 from adverse currency translation.</p><p>Diluted EPS for the first six months fell by 12% to $2.61 per share, compared to $2.97 per share in the previous year. The first half of 2012 included a $0.16 per share benefit from the release of a Korean deferred tax valuation allowance that was substantially offset by $0.11 per share of restructuring and impairment charges and $0.03 of business integration costs. The first six months of 2011 had included a $0.75 gain per share from a NAFTA settlement with the Mexican government, partially offset by $0.13 of integration costs and $0.02 of restructuring charges. When these items are excluded, adjusted EPS increased by 9% from $2.37 per share to $2.59 per share in the first six months of 2012.</p><p>As of June 30th, 2012, total debt reached $1.84 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $440 million, respectively, compared to $1.95 billion and $401 million, respectively, as of December 31st, 2011. In the first six months of 2012, cash flow from operations amounted to $318 million, compared to $102 million in the same period of the previous year. Capital expenditures, net of disposals, were $128 million in the first six months of 2012, compared to $89 million for the first six months of 2011.</p><p>Fitch has <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/29/iduswna431520120829?RPC=49"">reaffirmed</a> its BBB rating on the company's debt, and upgraded the rating outlook from Stable to Positive. The rating agency attributes the upgrade to the company's progress in integrating the $1.4 billion acquisition of the National Starch business of Akzo Nobel N.V. (National Starch) as well as the earnings outperformance since the acquisition. The upgrade also reflects the larger size and the broader product portfolio as well as the fit and synergy between National Starch's expertise and leadership in specialty and modified starches for the processed foods industry and Ingredion's core competency in corn refining.</p><p>Ingredion maintains a competitive position in corn refining and starch-based ingredients, and has global operations as well as a well diversified customer base. It follows clear and conservative financial policies and is financially strong. The recent rise in corn prices due to the effects of the severe summer drought on the U.S. crop is bound to affect the company. It remains to be seen whether the higher costs can be passed on to customers. The uncertain global economic situation also raises questions about starch demand. Investors should watch these headwinds closely.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Immunocellular may even be able to do the technology behind Provenge one better, as the process behind administering IMUC's treatment holds some <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-the-dndn-blood-bath-could-immunocellular-s-technology-offer-an-assist-"">logistical advantages</a> over Dendreon's.  </p> <p>These logistical advantages, which are chiefly attributed to the reduced need for multiple cell &quot;harvestings&quot; from a patient during treatment, could potentially alleviate the growing pains experienced by Dendreon in terms of Provenge pricing and reimbursement.  Simply put, the reduced need for multiple cell harvestings should ultimately lead to more attractive pricing for IMUC's treatments than for Dendreon's Provenge and other similar products.</p> <p>Shares of IMUC flew to over two dollars for a time in 2011, mainly based on the potential of ICT-107, a potentially ground-breaking immunotherapeutic treatment for glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  ICT-107 has already proven to be very successful in Phase I, and interim results from an ongoing Phase II should start trickling in within the year.  </p> <p>From the two dollar mark, however, shares quickly retreated from those highs as financing concerns entered the picture and investors saw that Phase II results were not quite imminent. The retreat in price dropped the company's market cap to well under fifty million, hardly justifiable for a pipeline that holds a potentially game-changing technology and was heavily validated in early trials.</p> <p>That said, the tide could be shifting again.  With a new spotlight on the sector, and with financing concerns now out of the way, IMUC could be shaping up for another revival.</p> <p>Cancer immunotherapy stocks are again in the spotlight following the rejuvenation of Dendreon and rebounding Provenge sales, and the anticipated <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/ImmunoCellular-Therapeutics-bw-860302321.html?x=0"">financing deal</a> for IMUC, which for months weighed heavily on the share price, is now out of the way.</p> <p>Investors are now free to look towards the expected Phase II trial results.  Should those results come with the similar success of the Phase I trials, there's little doubt that a new round of investor interest would come the way of IMUC.  Developing companies in the sector tend to run during the lead-in to such results, as well, so it's not out of the question to expect that another speculative move to the upside could be in store for this year, similar to last year's run.</p> <p>Additionally, with big pharma more on the prowl right now than Lindsay Lohan at a New Year's Eve party, IMUC could also benefit from the occasional buyout speculation that has been dominating the industry these days.</p> <p>Short sellers usually take advantage of a company's small cap share price right around the time that financing deals are announced, but even with the significant price drop that accompanies such events, the longs are often times left with a nice buying opportunity with an eye towards the longer term.</p> <p>With trial results due within the year, and with a novel technology behind a potentially ground-breaking new treatment, don't expect IMUC to remain dormant for long.</p> <p><strong>Disclosure:</strong>  Long IMUC.</p>"
"1746212","2013-10-15 12:44:17","Will Lost Patents Force Roche Into Acquisition Mode?","<p><span>Herceptin</span><span>&reg;, <strong>Roche's (RHHBY.OB)</strong> leading brea</span>st cancer drug, which had revenues of over $6 billion in 2012, will lose its patent protection in 2014. Standing and waiting in the wings are dozens of generic companies looking to capitalize on this very large market potential. This will be a large revenue erosion for Roche, and the company will look to try to extend the life of the drug. The only way to accomplish this is to look for ways to modify the drug. Over the last few years, large pharmaceutical companies have accomplished this by using combination therapies to piggyback on their drugs. In June, <b>Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)</b> <a href=""http://www.thestreet.com/story/11953596/1/johnson-johnson-gets-key-cancer-drug-with-aragon-buy.html"">paid $650m</a>, plus $1 billion in milestones, for privately held Aragon Pharmaceuticals and the company's Phase 2 prostate cancer drug, ARN-509. J&amp;J is planning to use ARN-509 in combination with its blockbuster drug, Zytiga, also facing patent expiration in 2016. Moreover, <b>Reckitt Benckiser</b> <strong>(RBGPF.PK) </strong>held patent protection on its blockbuster drug Suboxone for over a decade. The company simply changed the delivery from sublingual tablet to film once patent protection began to expire, thus extending the patent. This is a trend that will not go away and, in fact, will only increase as pipeline starved large pharmaceuticals look to extend their drug patent lives. This brings me to <b>Galena Pharmaceuticals (GALE)</b>. As I looked for ways to invest based on this growing combination drug use trend, Galena was the company that grabbed my attention.</p><p><b>Why is Galena Interesting?</b></p><p>Galena currently has five drugs in its cancer pipeline, two each in Phase 1 and 2, and one in Phase 3. Galena also controls the rights to Abstral, a breakthrough cancer pain tablet that the company acquired from Orexo Pharmaceuticals in March. However, it is Galena's cancer pipeline that I want to focus on today. NeuVax, currently in Phase 3 trials for breast cancer, works by stimulating the patient's immune system to seek out and destroy residual cancer cells.</p><p>According to the National Cancer Institute, over 230,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with breast cancer annually. Of these women, about 75% test positive for Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2), but only 25% of all breast cancer patients are eligible for Herceptin&reg;. NeuVax is targeting the 50% of breast cancer patients not eligible for Herceptin who have HER2. This is a very large market potential for Galena. However, there is much more to this story and the reason for my interest in Galena as an investment candidate.</p><p><b>Galena</b><b>'s Connection to Roche</b></p><p><em>(click to enlarge)</em><a href=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/10/8/10443961-13812535413693697-Stock-Investor_origin.jpg"" rel=""lightbox""><img src=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/10/8/10443961-13812535413693697-Stock-Investor.jpg"" hspace=""6"" vspace=""6"" /></a></p><p>I was very interested when I discovered that NeuVax is also in a Phase 2 trial for combined use with Herceptin. That's right! NeuVax is being studied as a combination use drug with Herceptin. Success in this trial could extend the life of Herceptin for Roche and make Galena a very attractive takeover target.</p><p>In a <a href=""http://www.ddn-news.com/index.php?pg=77&amp;articleid=5730"">Phase 2 combination study</a>, none of the patients who received NeuVax and Herceptin had a recurrence, versus 11% who relapsed after getting Herceptin alone. NeuVax created a 78% reduction in breast cancer recurrence in patients who were node-positive. Of the 187 patients enrolled in the study, there were 108 in the vaccine group and 79 in the control group. Of the 53 patients who received at least one booster inoculation, a statistically significant disease-free survival rate of 95.9% was seen versus 79.7% in the control group. This strong data might have Roche at least considering Galena as a potential acquisition.<em>(click to enlarge)</em><a href=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/10/8/10443961-13812536810550408-Stock-Investor_origin.jpg"" rel=""lightbox""><img src=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/10/8/10443961-13812536810550408-Stock-Investor.jpg"" hspace=""6"" vspace=""6"" /></a></p><p><b>Galena</b> <b>as an Acquisition</b></p><p>Zytiga only has $1.6 billion in annual sales and J&amp;J has already moved to solidify its patent life for this drug with a huge outlay. Things are much more dire for Roche with a looming patent expiration for a much larger drug. If I use the $650m J&amp;J figure for a potential price for Galena, we arrive at a price three times what Galena is trading at currently. This does not take into account that NeuVax is much more advanced than ARN-509 in trials, nor the other pipeline drugs Galena has.</p><p>Currently, Galena trades at a market cap of $192m with $66m in cash, and an annual cash burn of approximately $24m. With the $6 billion in potential lost sales for Roche, as well as the added market for HER2 patients that is twice the size of the Herceptin market, Galena looks like a good fit. Galena is targeting the prostate and ovarian cancer research market as well with two Phase 2 trials underway. Ovarian cancer occurs in over 22,000 patients per year in the U.S. and is the most lethal gynecologic cancer.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>The clock is running out for Herceptin. Patent expiration is just around the corner. Galena currently has a Phase 2 drug that is showing tremendous success in combination trials with Herceptin. With J&amp;J paying $650m for a privately held company to keep its money- making drug alive, Galena has to at least be considered as a potential acquisition target. As a standalone breast cancer drug, NeuVax is targeting a market twice the size of the $6 billion per year Herceptin.</p><p>As a result, a valid question might be why Roche hasn't already acquired Galena? If NeuVax could really save Herceptin as a combination therapy, then a $650 million price tag seems quite small considering both the size of Roche and the revenue of Herceptin. The answer is most likely that Roche is wanting to see some data from the combination study and from Galena's Phase 3, 700 patient study for NeuVax as a standalone treatment. Long-term, this benefits Galena shareholders. Because if NeuVax is successful in either study, Galena's stock would be significantly higher than it is today, and would reflect the vaccine's total sales potential. Regardless, Roche doesn't have a lot of time to save its blockbuster drug, and this fact might mean that Galena is poised for a buyout, and Roche is willing to buy.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

"319764","2012-01-16 04:23:19","Pharma Leaders Emerging In Immunotherapy Approach To Fighting Glioblastoma","<p>One of the least understood areas of the body and of the most difficult to treat for disease, the human brain and its functions has dazzled and baffled scientists and physicians across the ages. Attempts to understand how it functions both physiologically and psychologically typically lead to one conclusion, the more we learn about it the more we realize we don&rsquo;t know about it. Diseases of the brain are difficult to diagnose and treat and are at the center of many areas of study and clinical trials. A primary brain cancer diagnosis strikes fear in its victims as the final outcome and quality of life up to that outcome is often seen as pre-determined with a poor prognosis.</p> <p>Glioblastoma multiforme ((GBM)) is one of the most aggressive primary cancer tumors. It accounts for approximately 50% of all functional tissue brain tumor cases and about 20% of all intracranial tumors. Affecting 4-5 new cases per 100,000 persons a year in the United States and worldwide, GBM is not one of the more common or well-known cancers. However, with a current median overall survival of approximately 12 months with the standard of care and only 3 months with no treatment, the diagnosis is devastating for its victims. Only modest gains have been made in the last 30 years, with median survival increases of only about 9 months in that time frame and current prognosis of only 25% of patients surviving 2 years and fewer than 10% reaching 5 years.</p>  <p><b>Chronology of Treatments</b></p>  <p><b>Resection and Radiation &ndash; 1970&rsquo;s to 1990&rsquo;s as Standard of Care</b></p> <p>Like many cancers, earlier treatments often involved resection (surgical removal) of the tumor and healthy surrounding marginal tissue. The obvious problem posed with Glioblastoma is the potential degradation of brain function as the brain tissue is removed. However, successful resection of Glioblastoma is possible and did increase median survival by about 6 months, giving the patient about 9 months average median overall survival. Still part of the standard of care protocol today, surgical removal has been more fully perfected with median survival times increasing to about a year now with the most success in younger patients treated in the earliest stages of the disease. Often used in conjunction with surgery, radiation treatment was also implemented along the same time period. Like resection, it increased survival to about 9 months median overall survival and is the preferred method of treatment for inoperable tumors and for those over 70 years of age. The side effects of the radiotherapy are typical with this kind of treatment with the most prevalent ones being hair loss, fatigue and nausea.</p>  <p><b>Chemotherapy &ndash; One approval 2003 via an implant and another approval 2005</b></p> <p>In 2003 the first <a href=""http://www.virtualtrials.com/newsarticle.cfm?item=1914"">drug was approved</a> for GBM via an implanted device. Containing controlled release carmustine, the Gliadel Wafer (now marketed by Eisai Inc. (PINK: ESALY.PK)) was approved for use in conjunction with radiation and surgery as an adjuvant. After the tumor is surgically removed, the wafer is placed into the remaining cavity where it will reside and slowly release its active ingredient. Meanwhile, radiotherapy could be used to further fight any remaining cancer cells or newly formed ones. This multi-faceted approach yielded trial data in which survival was prolonged in the Gliadel Wafer group with median survival increasing to 13.9 months from 11.6 months, p&lt;0.05.</p>  <p>In March of 2005 the <a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-approves-temodarr-temozolomide-as-treatment-for-patients-with-newly-diagnosed-glioblastoma-multiforme-54276247.html"">FDA approved TEMODAR</a>, produced by Schering-Plough (it merged with Merck in 2009 to form Merck &amp; Co. (NYSE: MRK)), in conjunction with radiotherapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM. The approval of TEMODAR with the active ingredient temozolomide was based on a 573 patient phase 3 study in which the group of patients treated with TEMODAR and radiation yielded the following: 27.2% alive at two years, 16% at three years, 12.1% at four years, and 9.8% at five years. For comparison to those treated with radiation alone, 10.9% were alive at two years, 4.4% at three years, 3.0% at four years, and 1.9% at five years. Median overall survival for the patient set was 14.6 months as opposed to 12.1 months for the patient set receiving radiotherapy only. The results were markedly better, but there is obviously much room for improvement for efficacy and additionally for <a href=""http://www.drugs.com/sfx/temodar-side-effects.html"">safety</a>. Forty-nine percent of those treated with TEMODAR reported one or more severe or life-threatening events, most notably fatigue (13%), convulsions (6%), headaches (5%) and low blood platelet levels (5%).</p>  <p>Chemotherapy trials for GBM are still underway for many drugs, however the toxic nature of these agents has proven to be a formidable foe in the battle of the elevated levels required to have potent efficacy versus reduced levels necessary to keep the safety aspect of the treatments in check. This trade-off is even worse for primary cancers of the brain because of the blood-brain barrier that many drugs cannot efficiently penetrate. Additionally, many cancer stem cells (CSC&rsquo;s) survive both radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments and live to create another generation of cancer tumor cells to proliferate. These new cells and tumors are often more immune to the chemical agent that attacked their predecessors. Damage occurring to surrounding healthy cells is also a bigger concern in the brain due to reduced functionality of the brain along with the fact that the brain is more limited in its ability to repair itself than other parts of the body. It appears that a more targeted approach to GBM is necessary that doesn&rsquo;t fully rely on the &ldquo;poison the biologic system and hope the healthy cells survive and the fast-growing cancer cells are killed&rdquo; logic of old.</p>  <p><b>Immunotherapy &ndash; A Targeted Treatment Approach for GBM</b></p>  <p><b>VEGF Inhibition</b></p> <p>In their earliest stages of development, cancer tumors rely on surrounding blood vessels to supply the necessary nutrients via diffusion. However, as their growth advances they require higher volumes of blood supplied via their own vessels. To do such, they rely on their own angiogenesis (blood vessel formation) promoters. The most common promoter implicated is vascular endothelial growth factor ((VEGF)). Its inhibition or elimination is proven to be a key mechanism in a new generation of cancer drugs termed VEGF inhibitors. In May of 2009 the <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/cancer/brain-cancer/news/20090506/fda-oks-avastin-for-glioblastoma"">FDA approved</a> the first VEGF inhibitor for recurrent GBM in the form of Genentech&rsquo;s (Pink: RHHBY.PK) Avastin. At the time of the approval, trial data supporting the approval did not indicate an improvement of survival of the patients, only that there was a significant tumor response in 20-26% of the patients that lasted for about 4 months. Genentech is conducting two phase III trials using Avastin in newly diagnosed GBM and will likely apply for regulatory approval in the U.S. in 2013.</p>  <p><b>Heat Shock Protein and T-Cell Mediated Immunotherapy Approach</b></p> <p>Agenus, Inc. (NASDAQ: AGEN) Prophage Series vaccines are autologous (patient specific and manufactured from the patient&rsquo;s own cells). They contain the <a href=""http://www.agenusbio.com/about/platforms.shtml"">heat shock protein, gp96</a>, and associated peptides that are purified from the patient&rsquo;s tumor tissue. Agenus' <a href=""http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/news.html?d=238477"">G-200 phase II trial data</a> for patients with recurrent GBM were promising with 93% of the patients alive at 26 weeks after surgery with a median overall survival of 47.6 weeks. Measures of immune response after treatment indicated a significant localized tumor-specific CD8+ T cell response as well as innate immune responses as marked by a significant increase in levels of circulating NK (natural killer) cells. These NK cells play a major role in the destruction of tumor cells and virus-infected cells and kill by releasing cytoplasmic granules of proteins called perforin and granzyme that cause the target cell to die. Updates on G-200 should be forthcoming with a substantial update likely at ASCO in June 2012. Like other immunotherapy vaccines, G-200 is designed to target only cancerous cells, not healthy cells. This targeted approach should limit the toxicities associated with traditional broad acting chemotherapy or radiotherapy. A Phase 2 trial testing G-100 in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is currently enrolling with approximately 24 patients treated per Agenus' November 16th <a href=""http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/news.html?d=238477"">press release</a>. If the G-100 has similar efficacy in new-diagnosed GBM as the G-200&rsquo;s phase II trail for recurrent GBM, this will mark a huge step in moving the median overall survival beyond three and perhaps even four years for these patients.</p>  <p><strong>Another Novel Dendritic Cell Immunotherapy Approach</strong></p> <p>Northwest Biotherapeutics (OTC: NWBO.OB) is in a phase II study of its autologous cellular therapy <a href=""http://www.nwbio.com/clinical_dcvax_l.php"">DCVax-L</a> for newly diagnosed GBM. Phase I results were impressive with a median survival of 33.8 months. Most of the original 19 patients have no evidence of tumor recurrence and four have survival times without progression or recurrence of their cancer that now extends beyond 45 months. Touting their &ldquo;crossover treatment&rdquo; policy in which members of the placebo group are allowed to crossover and start receiving the DCVax-L vaccine after certain clinical endpoints are met, Northwest last <a href=""http://www.nwbio.com/pdf/press2011.08.04.pdf"">updated</a> its phase II trial in August and should be due to give an enrollment update soon with perhaps an interim data analysis. Northwest is hoping that its crossover policy will attract additional physicians/clinics that may not otherwise be interested in having its patients possibly permanently assigned to the placebo group in which their prognoses would likely be poor. The next enrollment update will help determine if that policy is helping in that regard.</p>  <p><b>ICT-107 and CDX-110: Leaders Emerging?</b></p>  <p><b>EGFR and EGFRvIII Growth Regulator Inhibition</b></p> <p>Celldex Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CLDX) CDX-110 is an off-the-shelf (not autologous) vaccine consisting of 13 amino acids unique to EGFRvIII, a functional variant of the epidermal growth factor receptor ((EGFR)). The targeting of EGFR is of proven benefit with approvals for similar vaccines such as YM Biosciences nimotuzumab, RHBBY&rsquo;s Tarceva, AstraZeneca&rsquo;s gefitinib and Bristol Meyer&rsquo;s cetuximab. CDX-110&rsquo;s benefit will be limited to those GBM patients with over-expression of EGFRvIII (roughly 25-30% of those EGFR-positive GBM patients). Meanwhile, the aforementioned approved drugs targeting EGFR (EGFR inhibitors) have the benefit of targeting the over expressed EGFR (in 40-50% of GBM patients). However, CDX-110 should not be overlooked as a possible treatment as its treatment in the correctly targeted group is showing tremendous promise.</p>  <p>Trial data, generated by three phase II trials on CDX-110 by Celldex and its former partner Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) targeting the EGFRvIII+ GBM patient set have been impressive. The 18-patient ACTIVATE trial yielded data with a median progression free survival ((PFS)) of 14.2 months, median overall survival of 24.6 months and 50% OS at 24 months. The 22-patient ACT II trial data yielded data with a median PFS of 15.3 months, median OS of 24.4 months and 50% OS at 24 months. In the largest trial, ACT III with 65 patients, the data set is still being accumulated with median PFS of 12.3 months, median OS of an estimated 24.3 months and estimated 50% OS at 24 months. As with many off-the-shelf immunotherapy vaccines, the most reported side effects were local injection-site reactions. In the ACT III trial, reversible hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 5% of patients with one reaction being reported as serious and requiring discontinuation of treatment.</p>   <p><b>Dendritic and Targeted Cancer Stem Cell Approach</b></p> <p>ImmunoCellular Therapeutics&rsquo; (OTC: IMUC.OB) ICT-107, like DCVax-L, is an autologous vaccine. The vaccine is produced by removing some of the patient's white blood cells ((WBC)) and culturing them in a laboratory with purified antigens, similar to those on GBM cells. The patient's WBC/DC (dendritic cells) that have been exposed to the tumor antigens will then be reintroduced to the patient as a vaccine over the course of the treatment. The hope is that the ICT-107 vaccine will stimulate the patient's immune response by helping to &ldquo;teach&rdquo; the body that the GBM cells and stem cells are foreign causing it to target the residual GBM tumor cancer stem cells ((CSC)). This will be done after a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy to increase progression free survival or even induce total remission. The targeted cancer stem cells, and their resistance to standard chemotherapy agents, are thought to be the culprits behind the recurring nature of GBM and many other cancers. More information on these cells can be found in <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/306203-immunocellular-therapeutics-cancer-stem-cell-drug-garnering-much-attention"">this article</a> and this excellent National Institute of Health ((NIS)) <a href=""http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/2006report/2006chapter9.htm"">report</a>.</p>   <p>Phase I <a href=""http://www.centerwatch.com/clinical-trials/results/new-therapies/nmt-details.aspx?CatID=685"">results</a> were impressive on a 16-patient set of newly diagnosed GBM that received three injections of the vaccine after the standard of care treatment with surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. Median OS for the patient set was 38.4 months with a median PFS of 17 months. The three-year OS for the patient set was 55% with 6 patients having no recurrence of the tumor after three years. 19% were still disease-free after four years with one patient now approaching 5 years of PFS. Safety data for ICT-107 compared favorably to current treatments with no serious events while minor side effects were reported such as fatigue, skin rash and itching. With a favorable median OS of 38.4 months versus CDX-110&rsquo;s 22.4 months, ICT-107 phase I data are currently superior with a larger patient population target set without the limitations of treating only the GBM patient population that is EGFRvIII over expressed. ICT-107 <a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01280552?term=ict-107&amp;rank=1"">major inclusion criteria</a> are that the patients enrolled are HLA-A1 or HLA-A2 positive. <a href=""http://www.allelefrequencies.net/"">Published data</a> indicate this includes over 75% of the human population (depending on ethnicity) while CDX-110 has a smaller target group of 10-15% of the total GBM population set.</p>  <p>ImmunoCellular <a href=""http://www.imuc.com/imuc-01-04-2011"">initiated a Phase II trial</a> on ICT-107 in January 2011 on patients with newly diagnosed GBM. The double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial will enroll about 150 patients at more than 20 sites throughout the U.S. Patients will receive at least four vaccinations of ICT-107 on top of the current standard of care with enrollment completion by Q2 2012 and interim data analysis release during Q4, 2012. The phase I trial utilized three injections of ICT-107 over the course of the treatment. With the additional one or more injections in the phase II trial the efficacy may yet be additionally enhanced with a likely acceptable safety profile given the margin of increase allowed as indicated by the phase I trial. With hopes high due to the stellar phase I data behind it, this $42.4 million biotech will start capturing attention as 2012 catalysts approach. Analysts are already taking note as a December 1st announcement that Global Hunter Securities analysts has given the common stock a <a href=""http://www.streetinsider.com/New+Coverage/Global+Hunter+Securities+Starts+ImmunoCellular+Therapeutics+(IMUC)+at+Buy%3B+Compelling+Value+Proposition+in+Cancer+Immunotherapy+Group/6987594.html"">$5.00 price target</a> with a &ldquo;buy&rdquo; rating. This is only the beginning as ImmunoCellular is on the forefront of immunotherapy vaccines for GBM and other cancers with a wide range of applications. Will ImmunoCellular experience the same type of run that another immunotherapy company, Dendreon (NASDAQ: DNDN), saw in 2009 with its Provenge cancer vaccine for prostate cancer? GBM is certainly not as common as prostate cancer and has a smaller market, but positive data for phase II ICT-107 will help further legitimize ImmunoCellular&rsquo;s pipeline and its possible indications for other cancers and could vault the company into the spotlight and world of Big Pharma.</p>   <p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.</p>"
"817411","2012-08-20 11:59:57","Weekly Stock Watch For August 20","<p><em>At the conclusion of each week,</em> <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/""><em>VFC's Stock House</em></a> <em>examines some news items, stocks and stories that made headlines during the previous trading week, but may also make headlines or influence trends during the upcoming week as well.</em></p><p>During one of the climatic scenes of 1989's baseball hit 'Field of Dreams,' Shoeless Joe Jackson offered the kid rookie - Archie &quot;Moonlight&quot; Graham - some advice as he took the plate at a pivotal point in his first ballgame. &quot;He's not gonna wanna load the bases, so look low and away,&quot; noted Joe before then warning, &quot;but watch out for in your ear,&quot; as Moonlight had just winked at the pitcher.</p><p>The markets this week are at a similar point in the summer trading season as investors have been winking at the market for months, in a mocking manner, while watching prices rise and rise on questionable fundamentals. The bullish trends that culminated in the S&amp;P achieving highs not witnessed in years were duly noted, but it was also noted, in a deeper look, that the DOW reported two of its lowest-volumed days of the year last week. How many times can we wink at the market before potentially seeing that late-summer swoon materialize?</p><p>Investors are likely preparing for two different scenarios, just like Moonlight Graham did.</p><p>Plans are being devised based on strategies that entail taking advantage of continued bull-market gains, which include playing some continued trades while looking for more encouraging economic data, but investors are also considering that the recent rally may have lacked real conviction - especially since the current corporate earnings season was lackluster, to say the least, and no one really seemed to notice.</p><p>If last week was a sign of anything, it was a sign of unpredictability. Therefore, investors are wise to take precautions against both the bull and bear theories. If ever there was a time for balance, now's it - you don't want to be too short or too long on anything. Diversity is key.</p><p>Given the fact that the US presidential race is up in the air right now and no one can predict which candidate's policies to expect to be implemented in Washington in November, there's reason to believe that many will look to abandon the market and switch to cash as the drama plays out all over TV and on the Facebook page debates, that get really annoying, by the way. That means a September swoon could be in store and it should be on the back of every investor's mind. The only factors that could combat that threat would be overly-encouraging signs of economic growth, either in the US or globally, but it still looks like 'nothing gives' on that front, too.</p><p>There will be some key events to monitor during the coming week, though, chiefly in the name of the Fed minutes that are set for a Wednesday release. The most recent round of housing data will follow and both could provide solid indicators, one way or another, as to how the economy is trucking along.</p><p>The final rounds of the primary earnings season are also quickly upon us, but the trend has been underwhelming, thus far, so we can't expect help on that front. The US markets did post another solid trading week last week, however, so there could be some more excitement in store. That said, with so many uncertainties still making their way to the horizon, both in the markets and in terms of geo-politics, expect investors to start growing a little bit more edgy. That spells potential volatility.</p><p><em>As always, there are sure to be plenty of stocks and stories to keep an eye on. Here's just a few of them...</em></p><p><strong>Healthcare, Biotech, Pharmaceutical:</strong></p><p><strong>Amarin Corporation (AMRN)</strong><strong>:</strong> Amarin shares traded relatively flat last week after having <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-amarin-s-share-price-dip-and-other-healthcare-stories-to-watch-amrn-dndn-ssh-mric"">dropped big</a> following the announcement of an <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-weekly-stock-watch-week-of-july-30-amrn-hznp-ctso-fb-znga-mcd-yum-sbux"">FDA approval</a> for Vascepa in the treatment of very high triglycerides during the closing days of July. Interest will still be very heavy on this company and its stock during the coming week, too, as an expected key catalyst that should have materialized last week failed to do so.</p><p>Ever since the Vascepa approval, investors have been monitoring the situation as to whether or not the product will receive a new chemical entity (NCE) status from the FDA. Such a designation would extend the product's exclusivity on the market and help investors and potential buyers of the company better gauge Vascepa's overall lifetime value. The decision was to be announced this past Friday but that decision will now be somewhat <a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/e/120817/amrn8-k.html"">delayed</a>, as explained last week, still leaving a few uncertainties to deal with in the eyes of investors.</p><p>Regardless, the current AMRN market cap has shares trading at levels that could be quite attractive to those banking on a potential blockbuster future for Vascepa or an eventual buyout of the company. AMRN has run to nearly twenty bucks on news of a buyout before, and could likely do so again if the speculation heats up. Should it look like the company has decided against selling, then a rebound in share price may take longer to be realized as Amarin will need ample time to ramp up commercialization and start the revenue stream flowing on its own.</p><p>Aside from these above-mentioned catalysts, news on additional patent protection is due to come in over the short term and the company also plans to file later this year for a more broad application of Vascepa in the treatment of high triglycerides than what was included in the original submission.</p><p>When no NCE news came on Friday, AMRN shares closed down by over two percent. As speculation surrounding that designation continues, this will still be a hot story to keep an eye on for both the potential of Vascepa on the open market and for Amarin's potential as a buyout play. Any combination of news on any of the above-noted catalysts could lead to a quick rebound in AMRN share price.</p><p><strong>Synergy Pharmaceuticals (SGYP)</strong><strong>:</strong> Synergy shares closed Friday up by nearly four percent on the day, capping off a strong week that saw the company's share price rise by over a buck in all - good for a nearly thirty percent gain in just five days. Volume remained within the daily norms during the run.</p><p>Synergy is entering a very exciting period in its development that could make or break the future. Last week's run could be a measure that investors are taking notice to that effect. As <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-synergy-pharmaceuticals-tuesday-trial-update-confirms-end-of-year-milestone-results"">discussed</a> early last week, the company's Phase IIb/III Plecanatide trial in the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) has completed enrollment and is coming to an end, with results expected for release later this year. It is widely expected that the results from this trial, which enrolled well over eight hundred people in total, will be positive, given the encouraging results from earlier studies and the success of<strong> Ironwood Pharmaceuticals' (IRWD)</strong> Linaclotide, which shares the same origins and mechanism of action as Plecanatide.</p><p>In fact, although a potential market competitor to Synergy, Ironwood's success could directly impact the potential of the SGYP share price and that may also have been a factor in last week's run. Ironwood is slated to receive an approval decision from the FDA for Linaclotide within weeks now - 12 September, to be exact - and a positive decision on that front should also bode well for Synergy, given the above-noted similarities in treatments. What serves as validation for Linaclotide could, too, serve as validation for it's &quot;sister&quot; product, Plecanatide. Once on the open market, however, Plecanatide could have the ultimate advantage as patients have <a href=""http://www.digestionblog.com/plecanatide-linaclotide-similar-experimental-treatments-for-ibs/"">noted</a> a much softer side effect profile than what has been <a href=""http://www.centerwatch.com/clinical-trials/results/new-therapies/nmt-details.aspx?CatID=247"">seen</a> with Linaclotide use, at least thus far in development. Such advantages could quickly allow Plecanatide to gain market share, even though Linaclotide will make market first.</p><p>It's a rare case in this sector, but in this situation what's good for Ironwood is good for Synergy. Therefore, Ironwood's pending approval catalyst should also be watched by Synergy shareholders. Investors may have keyed in on that fact, which is likely played a role in last week's SGYP price spike.</p><p>Additionally, Aegis Capital Cor <a href=""https://aegis.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=078ae400-d202-49bb-a012-50d84f47333b&amp;mime=pdf&amp;co=aegis&amp;id=gmcerrone%40bloomberg.net&amp;source=mail"">tagged</a> SGYP last Tuesday with a price target of $25 following the announcement of the trial completion. Aegis also noted the expectations of positive trial results and the potential of Plecanatide on the open market. In terms of valuation, Aegis noted the following:</p><blockquote class=""quote""><p><em>&quot;Synergy's current market cap of about $250mm does not adequately value the potential of Plecanatide and the firm's platform technology, in our view. We also note that linaclotide is currently valued at a level approaching $3bn based on the market cap of Ironwood Pharmaceuticals (IRWD/NASDAQ - Buy), the originator of this agent.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>The Aegis valuation also likely played a factor in SGYP's rebound. The next few months will make or break Synergy and the catalysts are due to start rolling in at a rapid pace in just weeks. Since the markets trade ahead of news, look for continued movement and volatility in the SGYP share price. A hot story in the sector to watch for the coming week, and for well into the third and fourth quarters.</p><p><strong>Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (SPPI)</strong><strong>:</strong> Although reporting another round of impressive earnings and revenue growth, shares of Spectrum have finally fallen victim to a huge number of shorts who had been piling on as the stock recently rose from below ten bucks to over seventeen. The ensuing decline caught many off guard as sales of the company's flagship product, FUSILEV, has been consistently gaining steam quarter after quarter and even the skeptical seem to have become believers in its potential to continue growing in the market. Additionally, Spectrum's secondary product, Zevalin, while not returning huge revenue just yet, is predicted to also start raking in a more significant revenue stream.</p><p>Shares were down by five percent on Friday as numerous new developments circulated the wires and could play key rolls in the near-term trading of this stock, making Spectrum a hot story to watch next week, especially given the recent pullback and the uncertainty of how long it may take for the bulls to regain control of their prized stock.</p><p>In Friday news, the company <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/spectrum-pharmaceuticals-allos-therapeutics-announce-213200457.html"">announced</a> another extension of the <strong>Allos (ALTH)</strong> deal, leaving investors to wonder why Spectrum is having so much trouble gaining enough support for this transaction if it is in fact as positive a deal as the company has previously expressed. Each and every delay, and there have been a few now, erodes investor confidence, which is likely a partial cause of Friday's share price decline.</p><p>The company also <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/spectrum-pharmaceuticals-launches-broad-based-110000716.html"">announced</a> last week plans to initiate a more rigorous marketing campaign for FUSILEV. According to a Wednesday press release, the campaign will include increasing the sales force footprint, a new website, &quot;<em>health care professional educational tools and resources, digital and online campaign, and peer-to-peer live educational programs.&quot;</em></p><p>While this campaign is expected to boost an already impressive growth rate for FUSILEV, some wonder the need to expend the extra resources to do so when recent success has already been so robust. Spectrum does have cash to spare, however, and this may be a move to solidify and consolidate those recent successes into a longer term winning strategy. Investors can hardly argue with that.</p><p>In yet another move to strengthen the SPPI share price, management recently boosted its plans for a share buy-back program from $25 million to $100 million. Given the company's cash on hand - which sits at $280 million, according to the most recent quarterly reports - and growth in free cash flow, the above-noted moves are affordable and look to capitalize on already-proven models of success.</p><p>It's likely, in my opinion, that without that huge short interest we followed over the past few months, Spectrum shares would still be trading at or near their recent highs, making the current prices a relative bargain. Eventually, however, Spectrum will need to make a move or two to boost its pipeline and vary its revenue streams for investors to become whole-heartedly confident in this company's move to the mainstream.</p><p>Still a hot one to watch.</p><p><strong>Neostem, Inc. (NBS)</strong><strong>:</strong> Shares of NeoStem Inc were down by three percent to close the week last Friday, but recent developments at the company have this story as one worth keeping an eye on. The company <a href=""http://www.nasdaq.com/article/neostem-reports-data-safety-monitoring-board-recommends-continuation-of-preserve-ami-phase-2-trial-20120815-00231"">reported</a> last Wednesday that it had received approval from a data monitoring committee to continue moving forward with its Phase II PreSERVE trial, designed to measure the effectiveness of AMR-001 in preventing or treating major cardiac events following heart attacks. Such an approval, while by no means to be considered a major catalyst, is a firm validation of trial progress, especially for any company operating in a relatively new and high-profile sector - such as that of regenerative medicine and stem cell research. Regenerative medicine is predicted by many to be THE next big leap in medical technology and any progress by companies in the sector are highly watched by investors.</p><p>Developments of <strong>Advanced Cell Technology (ACTC.OB)</strong> over the past couple of years, for example, have led to triples in share price for that company at times while offering hope for patients suffering from severe eyesight loss. NeoStem, in its own right, has also recognized some recent milestones and is <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-neostem-positioning-as-a-leader-in-regenerative-medicine"">positioning</a> to become a big player in the field. Most notably, some recent financial decisions and share price action have this company on the list of stocks to watch this week, and for the duration of the year.</p><p>NBS shares began climbing a few months ago on positive pipeline progress and then received a further boost as the company decided to divest its majority stake in a subsidiary, Erye, in order the strengthen its balance sheet. Through the noted divestiture, as outlined in the company's <a href=""http://www.nasdaq.com/article/neostem-announces-quarterly-results-and-business-update-20120814-00182"">quarterly report</a>:</p><blockquote class=""quote""><p><em>&quot;NeoStem expects to receive $12.3 million in cash and further bolster its balance sheet by removing $35 million in short- and long-term debt obligations through the divestiture of Erye. Fifty percent of the cash price has now been received directly or is in escrow and closing is expected to occur over the next 6-10 weeks.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Additionally, the company has raised $17.6 million year to date through warrant exercises and equity sales. Those sums significantly strengthen the company's balance sheet and support the development of AMR-001, which - if successful in trials and ultimately approved - would enter a billion dollar market.</p><p>With recent moves to strengthen the financials being undertaken and with a potentially highly-lucrative treatment being developed in a groundbreaking technological field, Neostem is one to keep an eye on, especially given the pullback last week.</p><p><strong>Lpath, Inc. (LPTN.OB)</strong><strong>:</strong> Shares of Lpath had been on the rise and reignited with life over the past week while hitting highs of nearly a dollar to close out July, marking a rise of well over thirty percent than where those shares were trading just weeks before. As is normal in the biotech sector especially, profit taking took effect and a retreat followed the spike. LPTN traded down by over five percent on Friday and may be back in 'buy territory' as a key trial catalyst is still pending.</p><p>Earlier this year two ongoing proof-of-concept trials for iSONEP were halted due to FDA concerns with the company's fill/finish contractor, Formatech, Inc. Formatech was found not to be in compliance with FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, but the trial halt had nothing to do with the safely trial or effectiveness of iSONEP. A new contractor was found and, according to the company's most recent <a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/e/120813/lptn10-q.html"">quarterly report</a> issued last week, Lpath is just awaiting the go-ahead from the FDA to restart the trials. That trial re-start could prove a significant catalyst for the company, as shares were trading for well over a dollar before the trial halt took effect.</p><p>Lpath, a recognized leader in the field of lipid-based therapeutics, also stands on much more solid ground than many other developing companies in similar stages of development due to a large investment and vote of confidence from <strong>Pfizer (PFE)</strong><strong>.</strong> Pfizer saw the potential of this company's technology and invested early in iSONEP while retaining a 'first right of refusal' for other products in the company's pipeline. The pipeline, however, is still just in Phase II development or earlier, so there is still a ways to go before potential approval.</p><p>The trial re-starts could come at any time, as initial indications were expectations of August. With that being known, LPTN is a stock to watch right now.</p><p><em>Also worth watching...</em></p><p><strong>Internet/Technology:</strong></p><p><strong>Facebook, Inc. (FB)</strong><strong>:</strong> Facebook, Inc. continues to disappoint as a key lockout period ended last week that resulted in the FB share price setting a new 52-week low of nineteen dollars as investors bailed on falling projections of growth. The lockout period had previously kept many investors who participated in the IPO from selling, but all bets were off when the lockout ended. Although a string of acquisitions and moves to strengthen the company's position in the mobile market provide hope for the future, investors are still unconvinced that the business plan can succeed in the mobile market.</p><p>The potential is there for an eventual rebound, especially at the first signs of mobile growth, but the next quarterly report seems like an eternity away right now and each week potential investors are losing conference with the continued losses in share price.</p><p>Still a huge player - if by name only right now - in the Internet and ad-hosting arena and well worth keeping an eye on, but it's likely that we have not seen the last of the selling. As previously discussed, a trip to the mid-teens could materialize, especially if the broad market takes a U-turn and drops.</p><p><strong>Explosive Trace Detection (ETD) / Global Defense:</strong></p><p><strong>Implant Sciences (IMSC.PK)</strong><strong>:</strong> Implant will be a hot one to watch this week as it is the last week before the most significant catalyst in the company's development is potentially due to take place. The company has long advertised August 27th as the date that the US Transportation Security Administration ((TSA)) is set to decide during the last week of August on whether or not to approve Implant's Quantum Sniffer (QS) ETD technology for inclusion on the TSA list of qualified products. Such an approval by the TSA would free up the Sniffer technology to land at the heart of airport and airline security around the nation, and also in nations - such as Japan - that follow TSA approval guidelines.</p><p>Another key catalyst date to keep in mind is December 3rd. It is on that date that the TSA has <a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/press/releases/2012/0516.shtm"">mandated</a> that all inbound-US cargo on passenger aircraft will be screened for explosives. Should Implant receive the Sniffer approval later this month, the potential is there to land immediate and significant government contracts, especially since the QS technology hold key advantages over competition that is already on the market.</p><p>The date with the TSA is slated for the following Monday, so investors looking to play this potential catalyst could start - or continue - taking positions this week. Already having made significant progress in landing overseas deals for the QS technology through 2012 thus far, the TSA approval is the event that has the potential to land Implant Sciences on the map as a big player in airport and airline security, in addition to becoming a name in the circles of government contracting.</p><p>Still trading on the pinks, IMSC may be losing some investor credibility in that light, but I would expect a news to a larger and more legitimate trading board, should this catalyst play through, in association with the name change eluded to by the CEO in a <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-implant-sciences-the-surge-continues"">recent interview</a>.</p><p>Bear in mind that playing unpredictable catalysts such as this one can prove risky. Shares could soar to at least a double on a positive outcome, but could also be significantly sliced if the decision does not turn out positive or if no update from the company is heard.</p><p>It's 'now time' for Implant and is well worth watching.</p><p><strong>Roundup:</strong> In terms of economic data releases and action, it could turn out to be a dull week ahead. The above-noted Fed minutes will be worth keeping an eye on, as will the housing data, but it looks as if a 'warm, fuzzy' has embraced the markets and investors are satisfied with current expectations of slow growth in the US, stagnant growth in Europe and declining growth rates in other key areas of the world, such as China. The China scenario is intriguing in itself. Barely two years ago the media told us all how there was no stopping the rising juggernaut in Asia, whose growth rates would only keep increasing for decades to come. Now we see those growth rates slipping a bit as pictures post on TV of work-force protests resulting from poor wages and working conditions. The cheap labor force that provided a foundation for growth now wants more, so where are the pundits now?</p><p>Europe is getting the bad rap right now, but the one activity you can still count on from that continent is a solid and affordable vacation - and that industry is still going strong, even in countries that are suffering on a larger economic scale. Manzanilla on the Spanish beaches of the Costa del Sol? Chicken piri-piri with some village wine in the Portugese Algarve?</p><p>No bank debt is keeping that action from taking place. Trust me on that.</p><p>Meanwhile, look forward to another week ahead. Keep an eye on sustained growth, if modest, but also watch for &quot;in your ear&quot; - which would be a late-summer stock slide based on too many geo-political variables.<em><br></em></p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[AMRN]], [[IMSC.PK]], [[SGYP]].</p>"
"1679942","2013-09-08 14:40:10","NeoStem And Neuralstem: 2 Early Regenerative Medicine Winners","<p>Back in April in my article titled, &quot;<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1379051-regenerative-medicines-time-has-come"">Regenerative Medicine's Time Has Come</a>&quot;, I covered two very interesting companies focused on this field: NeoStem Inc. (NBS) and Neuralstem Inc. (CUR).</p><p>Since the writing of the article, these stocks have gained the following:</p><p>CUR $1.20 to a high of $1.79 for a 49% gain</p><p>NBS $6.40 to a high of $8.90 for a 55% gain</p><p>As you can see, these stocks have outperformed the market in a big way. Since the writing of the article, there have been even more positive developments for both stocks, so today I will go over them in this update. NBS has four distinct divisions: Amorcyte, Athelos, PCT, and VSEL Technology. The focus is cardiovascular, autoimmune disorders, and regenerative medicine. There is also a new focus for NBS, intellectual property. Patents have become the buzzword in investments over the last several months so it is very good to see NBS is pursuing this possible revenue source.</p><p><em><em>(click to enlarge)</em><a href=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/9/7/10443961-1378574075136029-Stock-Investor_origin.jpg"" rel=""lightbox""><img src=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/9/7/10443961-1378574075136029-Stock-Investor.jpg"" hspace=""6"" vspace=""6"" /></a></em></p><p><a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/neostem-announces-1-10-reverse-113000928.html"">On July 16 the company performed</a> a 1 for 10 reverse stock split. This helped to dramatically reduce the outstanding shares of NBS and has, in part, helped to bring the stock to the attention of both investors and institutions. Also helping was the move from the NYSE to the Nasdaq market place. Average dollar trading volume has picked up nicely since the move, making it more appealing to investors that look for liquidity in stocks they own and trade.</p><p>In August NBS also <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/neostem-welcomes-robert-dickey-iv-113000509.html"">hired an investment banker</a> to be its new CFO. Robert Dickey IV has 15 years of management experience at life sciences companies. He has specific expertise in financing, M&amp;A, partnering/licensing transactions and project management, as well as international experience. The hiring of Dickey could signal the beginning of a new stage in the evaluation of NBS and also bring much needed institutional attention to the company.</p><p>Since my last article there has also been some key updates from NBS. First up, we have <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/neostem-announces-second-quarter-2013-211806148.html"">the earnings report</a> from August:</p><ul><li>Revenues were $4.4 million</li><li>Net losses from continuing operations were $8.6 million</li><li>$14.7 million in cash</li><li>Secured $4.6 million in grants</li><li>Progenitor Cell Therapy generated a 73% increase in revenues from Q1 2013</li><li>Market cap of $150m</li><li>Float 17.1m shares</li><li>Insiders own 15.8%</li></ul><p>PCT offers its clients and NeoStem cell processing and development capabilities on both the East and West Coasts of the U.S. and is pursuing plans to expand internationally. Per the last report, NBS also signed a contract with &quot; a large pharmaceutical company that is entering the cell therapy sector.&quot; Potential news on what company this is could positively impact the stock.</p><p>Most investors are unaware that <a href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/prnewswire/press_releases/2011/06/16/NY20858"">NBS has a partnership with the Vatican</a> that was made back in 2011. The goal of this deal is to promote the use of adult stem cells for treating disease rather than focusing research on embryonic stem cells. Back in August, NBS stated that its chief financial officer was named to the new position of vice president of strategic initiatives and mentioned this Vatican deal, perhaps signaling some progress or potential news on this in the near future.</p><p>Amorcyte is the lead product of NBS and the one I focused on the most last time. In the last few months, we have had some updates. Enrollment has continued in its PreSERVE Phase 2 clinical trial with 120 patients infused as of August 8, 2013. The trial is on track to complete patient enrollment for this trial in 2013 with data read out 6-8 months after the last patient is infused.</p><p><em><em>(click to enlarge)</em><a href=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/9/7/10443961-1378574130252242-Stock-Investor_origin.jpg"" rel=""lightbox""><img src=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/9/7/10443961-1378574130252242-Stock-Investor.jpg"" hspace=""6"" vspace=""6"" /></a></em></p><p>The leading cause of death continues to be heart disease, as you can see from the chart below. The market potential for NBS just on this indication could be huge.</p><p><em><em>(click to enlarge)</em><a href=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/9/7/10443961-13785741758836048-Stock-Investor_origin.jpg"" rel=""lightbox""><img src=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/9/7/10443961-13785741758836048-Stock-Investor.jpg"" hspace=""6"" vspace=""6"" /></a></em></p><p>NBS is presenting at many conferences in the month of September, which should bring more investor and institutional interest to the stock. The company may also release news too. The new CFO is definitely putting his investment banker talents to work getting interest in the company. <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/neostem-present-multiple-september-conferences-113000535.html"">Here is the list of the eight conferences NBS is attending</a>.</p><p><strong>CUR</strong> <strong>is</strong> <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=CUR+Profile"">a company focused</a> on the development of treatments for central nervous system diseases based on human neural stem cells. Its stem cell technology enables the isolation and expansion of human neural stem cells from various areas of the developing human brain and spinal cord. The key update for CUR over the last several months has been its spinal cord research and this has driven the stock up nicely during that time.</p><p>CUR is expected to begin its NSI-566 ALS Phase II trial in September at both Emory and the University of Michigan. The trial, with generous funding from the National Institutes of Health and the ALS Association, will focus on cervical area injections and an increase in both the number of injections each patient receives, as well as the number of cells in each injection. The ALS trial will treat eight patients with T2-T12 complete paralysis. The primary endpoints of the trial are to demonstrate safety and toxicity of NSI-566 to treat chronic spinal cord injury. The other key development in the last quarter was NSI-189 that also advanced in the second quarter. The FDA approved the third and final cohort in the major depressive disorder Phase Ib trial, and dosing has nearly been completed. The company expects data from the trial to be available in the second half of the year so news could come at any time sending shares higher, if results are positive.</p><p><a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/neuralstem-national-football-league-alumni-131500339.html"">Recently the company announced</a> that it is working with the National Football League Alumni Association (NFLAA) to develop a trial for treating NFL alumni members suffering from traumatic brain injuries ((TBI)), with NSI-189, the lead compound in the company's neurogenic drug platform. NSI-189 is currently in a Phase Ib clinical trial to treat major depressive disorder ((MDD)). This news from a few weeks ago should get more attention given the news last week that the NFL settled with the <a href=""http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/23380915/nfl-former-players-reach-settlement-in-concussion-lawsuit"">NFL players for $765m</a>, with some of that money being set aside for research. Given the earlier partnership announced by CUR, it is reasonable to assume CUR should see some potential funding for this trial in the near future. Also, the high profile nature of news like this also helps to bring more institutional interest into small cap stocks like CUR.</p><p>On Thursday CUR <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/neuralstem-raise-4-million-registered-110000372.html"">raised $4m in financing</a> at $1.60 per share. The risk on CUR, aside from bad trial results, is of course the constant financing the company does. However, on a positive note the recent financing actually saw shares of CUR increase so that can be viewed as a positive.</p><p>CUR continues to roll out positive news on its spinal cord pipeline. It also has a possible funding deal coming funded by the NFL. Developments on these could help the stock move nicely higher in the coming year. </p><p>In June, NBS was given a <a href=""http://www.streetinsider.com/New+Coverage/Aegis+Capital+Starts+NeoStem+%28NBS%29+at+Buy/8442508.html"">price target of $25 per share</a>. That is 300% higher than the current price of the stock, giving potential investors here tremendous upside potential. NBS is still an unknown stock to much of the investing world. The new CFO has a strong background in the investment-banking world and is starting to put that knowledge to work. As more and more institutions and investors discover NBS, the stock price will respond. Fund ownership is only 6.6% of NBS. With a very small float now of only 17m, once the stock gains attention, the accumulation should push shares much higher. Investors taking a serious look at NBS should also vie<span>w <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/assets/NeoStem-Investor-Presentation.pdf"">its investor presentation PowerPoint slide</a> f</span>or more information. </p><p>I will look back again in a few months to see how NBS and CUR have performed. Perhaps both stocks will see a similar 50% move.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

"1869981","2013-12-01 08:24:32","Medical Device Companies With Big Growth Potential","<p>The <a href=""http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/medical-devices-grow-3-percent-2012"">global medical device market</a> reached $331 billion in 2012, a growth rate of 3% from 2011. According to a report from <a href=""http://www.fiercemedicaldevices.com/story/analysts-device-market-growth-will-outpace-pharma-2018/2012-10-03"">EvaluatePharma</a>, the medical device market growth rate is expected to accelerate to 4.4% annually and reach $440 billion by 2018. That is a growth rate almost 33% faster than the prescription drug market, which is expected to grow at a rate of 2.5% annually. The medical device market includes everything from large imaging systems to tongue depressors. While the pharmaceutical market represents a larger amount of dollars, the device market is responsible for more orders and transactions.</p><p>While the majority of medical device dollars will go to giant healthcare companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), GE Healthcare (GE), Siemens (SI) or large medical device companies like Medtronics (MDT) or Boston Scientific (BSX), there are a number of smaller device makers that have been carving out a niche for themselves and could be good additions to one's portfolio. Below are three medical device companies whose stocks have the potential for significant gains in the coming year.</p><p><strong>NuVasive: BUILDING A BILLION-DOLLAR SPINE DEVICE INDUSTRY</strong></p><p><strong>NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA)</strong> has had an excellent run this year, and there are a number of factors in the company's favor that should allow the stock to continue to rise. NUVA carved out a growing business by developing minimally disruptive surgical devices and procedures for the spine. Back pain accounts for approximately 13.4 million trips to a doctor and 3.7 million emergency room visits annually in the U.S. And to achieve some relief, patients with acute, debilitating pain many times require spinal fusion. The spinal surgery device market is expected to grow at rate of 4% from <a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-spinal-surgery-devices-market-to-reach-87-billion-in-2018-185916532.html"">$6.5 billion in 2011 to $8.7 billion in 2018</a>.</p><p>The San Diego based <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/zacks/2013/11/07/nuvasive-sitting-pretty-with-increased-market-share-strong-growth-in-japan/"">company's lead platform</a> is called Maximum Access Surgery [MAS]. MAS combines several categories of spine surgery to minimize soft tissue damage during surgery. The device includes a proprietary software-based nerve avoidance system, which enables safe navigation of the body's nerve anatomy. Additionally, it uses intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring that provides information directly to the surgeon to help assess a patient's neurophysiologic status by electrically stimulating nerves via electrodes located on surgical accessories, along with electromyography monitoring. MAS is designed to eliminate the need to retract muscle laterally, therefore requiring a smaller incision than previously required. It also allows for maximum visualization for the surgeon while providing access to the spine via the side instead of the front or back, all which reduces surgery and recovery time.</p><p>Last month, NUVA reported strong <a href=""http://www.4-traders.com/NUVASIVE-INC-10279/news/NuVasive-Inc--NuVasive-Announces-Third-Quarter-2013-Financial-Results-17408759/"">third quarter results</a> with sales rising to $169 million, a 14% increase over same quarter 2012, which came in at $148.4 million. Gross profit for the third quarter reached $125.9 million up from gross profit of $110.6 million in the same quarter 2012. However, total operating expense also climbed to $114.3 million in the third quarter compared to $98.1 million for the same quarter 2012. The company also raised its 2013 guidance to $670 million in sales up from $655 million, well above 2012 revenues of $620.3 million.</p><p>NUVA has a market capitalization of $1.47 billion; year-over-year its stock has risen 140%, closing on Friday, Nov. 22nd at $33.48 per share. The stock has moved past Barclay's analysts' prediction of $30.00 per share, and is honing in on Zacks price target of $33.80 per share. However on Nov. 15th <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/nuvasive-price-target-raised-37-135904281.html"">RW Baird raised its price target</a> from $33.00 to $37.00, citing improving spine fundamentals. Separately <a href=""http://tickerreport.com/banking-finance/71442/needham-company-increases-nuvasive-price-target-to-40-00-nuva/"">analysts at Needham &amp; Company</a> raised their price target from $35.00 to $40.00 per share.</p><p>And while the company has yet to turn a profit, its portfolio comprises over 80 products including: lumbar, thoracic, cervical applications, neuromonitoring services, and a biologics portfolio including a collagen bone graft matrix and a cellular bone graft matrix. Along with its continued R&amp;D, these factors have helped grow the company to the fourth largest player in the spine device market. NUVA has built its business on focusing on developing less invasive devices for one area of the body: the spine. I like this company-- and if the company reaches or exceeds its yearly projections, I foresee this stock trending higher.</p><p><strong>Arch Therapeutics: GIVING SURGEONS A CRYSTAL CLEAR VISION TO SLOW BLOOD LOSS</strong></p><p>Blood loss has always been a concern in surgery. To address this, <strong>Arch Therapeutics, Inc. (ARTH)</strong> is testing liquid polymers designed to shorten the time it takes to stop bleeding (hemostasis), and to control fluid leakage during surgery and trauma care. The <a href=""http://www.archtherapeutics.com/technology/concept"">company s lead product</a>, AC5, is a clear biocompatible synthetic peptide made up of naturally occurring amino acids. When applied to a wound, it gets between the connective tissue and self-assembles into a physical, mechanical structure that provides a barrier to quickly stop the bleeding. If AC5 proves successful in doing so, the product would stop excess bleeding, making surgeries not just faster, but safer.</p><p>AC5 is currently in tests to stopping bleeding in minimally invasive (laparoscopic) and open surgical procedures. According to <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/arch-therapeutics-reports-on-current-activities-2013-07-30"">CEO, Dr. Terrence Norchi</a>, when AC5 was applied in preclinical tests, hemostasis occurred in less than 15 seconds, compared to 80 to 300 seconds when various control substances were applied. Other factors involved the nature of the control substance and the procedure performed.</p><p>With that said, investors should note that Arch is a nanocap stock, having a market cap of only $11 million, and also trades on the OTC exchange. The company does not have a great deal of cash and is just now set to begin human trials. Investors must acknowledge that risks are associated with the company, but should also realize that these risks are different from a typical biotechnology company because trials for AC5 are much cheaper. However, the risk or potential clinical failure exists the same way for all companies with clinical products.</p><p>One of the reasons that medical device companies are attractive is because they improve conventional methods of treatment and because studies are often speedier. Arch is trying to replace bandages in many industries, a practice that has been in place for 100s of years. Also, with biotechnology companies of this size, cash position is always a major concern. And while Arch investors must be wary of the company's financial position, the trials are much less expensive and quicker through the FDA process. For example, Arch has a net loss of just $500,000 in its last quarter, and its clinical process consists of AC5 being used in surgery then monitoring patients to determine if the sealant holds and if it leaks. Neither of which are expensive to monitor, and is far less than an oncology company manufacturing a complex product from human cells.</p><p>AC5 is not a headline-grabbing product, thus like many medical device companies, it does not receive a lot of attention. This fact does carry some weight on its market capitalization, as a reason for it being a Nano stock. However, if more successful and effective than bandages or other sealants, AC5 is well positioned to enter a large market, and its nanocap status won't matter.</p><p>While ARTH's product is still in the development stage (and therefore the company is not generating any revenue), AC5 has enormous potential, as the growth rate for sealants is expected to rise in the coming years. Annually there are roughly <a href=""http://www.archtherapeutics.com/news/news_releases/2013/08/arch-therapeutics-announces-plans-for-upcoming-activities"">114 million surgical and procedure-based wounds</a> worldwide: 36 million in the U.S. with 20-25% of these procedures performed laparoscopically. In 2012, global sales of hemostatic agents were over <a href=""http://www.archtherapeutics.com/market/market-overview"">$2.8 billion</a>, and an additional $1.3 billion were for fibrin and other sealants. Combined totals are expected to reach over $7 billion in 2017. The company touts its technology as an innovative platform with far reaching potential for products in the field of stasis and barrier applications. Furthermore, ARTH strives to develop sealant products based on its self-assembling peptide technology platform.</p><p>As it gets closer to begin human trials, ARTH is preparing for initial clinical trials and has been seeking out a large manufacturing partner to produce AC5 while engaging with both U.S. and EU regulators. If the company is successful moving forward in its tests, I can see the stock rise considerably from where it is today. This may just potentially be the sleeper stock of the medical device sector.</p><p><strong>LDR Holding: SMALL MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANY WITH LESS INVASIVE PLATFORMS</strong></p><p>Like NUVA, <strong>LDR Holding Corporation (LDRH)</strong> focuses on designing and commercializing novel and surgical technologies for the treatment of spine disorders. With headquarter locations in Troyes, France and Austin, Texas; the company went public on Oct. 9th, offering 5,000,000 shares of common stock at $15.00 per share. The stock has since risen over 10%. LDRH's primary products are based on its VerteBRIDGE fusion and Mobi non-fusion platforms, both of which are designed for applications in the cervical and lumbar spine areas. According to the company, both platforms enable its products to be less invasive, provide greater intra-operative flexibility, while offering simplified surgical techniques. This has promoted improved clinical outcomes for patients compared to existing alternatives.</p><p>Industry sources expect that the cervical disc replacement market will be one of the fastest growing segments of the U.S. spine implant market. In August, the company's Mobi-C cervical disc replacement device became the first device to receive approval from the FDA to treat both one-level and two-level cervical disc disease. <a href=""http://www.ldr.com/News/ArtMID/944/ArticleID/313/LDR-Receives-First-FDA-Approval-for-Two-Level-Cervical-Disc-Replacement"">Dr. Gregory A. Hoffman</a>, orthopedic surgeon and member of the SpineONE Medical Team at Ortho North East in Fort Wayne, Indiana commented:</p><blockquote class=""quote""><p>Mobi-C is unique in that it is now the only cervical disc replacement FDA approved for both one and two-level clinical use. The population of patients suffering from one or two-level cervical disc disease is large, and Mobi-C has the potential to make a significant and positive impact to the treatment of those patients.</p></blockquote><p>LDRH's other platform, VerteBRIDGE fusion, targets the cervical and lumbar spine fusion markets. The platform has been put to use in over 30,000 device implantations over the last five years. On Nov. 7th LDRH released its <a href=""http://tickerreport.com/banking-finance/60315/ldr-holding-corp-ldrh-releases-quarterly-earnings-results-misses-estimates-by-0-05-eps/"">third quarter earnings</a>, and revenues increased to $27.20 million, up 30.01% compared to $20.9 million in the same quarter 2012. This figure beat consensus estimates of $24.53 million. Revenue from exclusive technology products grew 36.7% to $22.9 million. Gross profit for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2013 came in at $67.1 million compared to a gross profit of $55.2 million for the same period in 2012. Net loss for the third quarter of 2013 totaled $8.0 million, or $1.68 per share. This included $4.7 million in noncash expenses associated with the revaluation of warrants leading up to the IPO-- compared to a net loss of $3.1 million, or $0.66 per share, for the same quarter 2012. As of Sept. 30, 2013, LDR had $11.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, $10.3 million in working capital.</p><p>LDRH is a $498 million market cap company. Its stock closed on Nov. 22nd at $21.98 per share. Earlier this month, analysts at <a href=""http://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/13/11/4048308/update-piper-jaffray-initiates-coverage-on-ldr-holding-o"">Piper Jaffray initiated coverage</a>, giving a LDRH a $26.00 price target. The stock has a consensus &quot;Buy&quot; rating and an average price target of $25.67. LDRH is a small company, with basically two product platforms; it is competing against some of the largest device manufacturers that have worldwide sales, marketing, and distribution channels. The company is also competing against NUVA, as both focus on developing medical devices for the spine. That being said, the company's products are innovative and address a specific segment of the overall spine implant market; but that market still represents $3.9 billion in sales in 2012. LDRH needs to develop a strong sales and marketing force, both in house and via distribution channels. And if it does, LDRH stock may well be a bargain today.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p><p>Medical device companies in the development stage do not generate the attention that developing drug companies receive; but a device company producing a novel product can be just as lucrative. The three device companies profiled today all have great potential to carve out a niche for themselves. While each carries its own level of risk/reward, I think all three could see their stocks rise significantly over the next year.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

"1028791","2012-11-26 14:56:17","Novel Immunotherapy And Delivery Systems Targeting Cancer May Target Gains For Investors","<p>There will be over 1.6 million new cases of cancer diagnosed in the <a href=""http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@epidemiologysurveilance/documents/document/acspc-031941.pdf"">U.S. in 2012</a> with close to 600 thousand people expected to die from the disease this year. Numbers are more staggering on a global scale; according the <a href=""http://gicr.iarc.fr/files/resources/20120906-WorldCancerFactSheet.pdf"">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) in 2008 alone there were over 12.7 million cases of new cancers diagnosed, and 7.6 million deaths related to the disease. About half of the cancer deaths are from 5 cancers - lung, stomach, liver, colorectal, and breast. On a positive note, with advancing treatments and early detection, the <a href=""http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/%40epidemiologysurveilance/documents/document/acspc-031941.pdf"">5 year survival</a> rate from cancer is up 67% over the past 10 years. Older technologies of systemic poisoning via chemotherapy or radiotherapy have gradually given way to more targeted means of therapy administration, which not only increases the effectiveness of the therapies, but also dramatically increases the safety profiles of the therapies used. Following are three companies, which I believe to be of great investment potential that has core business foci on targeted therapies. Although the three companies are very different and in different stages of development, each utilizes targeted therapy administration to target cancer cells while attempting to minimize exposure of healthy tissues.</p><p><strong>Immunotherapy</strong></p><p><a href=""http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/treatmenttypes/immunotherapy/immunotherapy-what-is-immunotherapy"">Immunotherapy</a> has become a major focus in treating many of today's most aggressive cancers, and new treatments using targeted immunotherapy are being developed and are in various phases of development. Also known as biologic therapy or biotherapy, this type of therapy uses or trains the body's immune system to target such cancers as breast, lung, colon, and skin. There are generally two methods of immunotherapy, stimulating the immune system to be able to battle the disease, or by adding certain proteins, called antibodies, into the immune system cells designed to either stop the cancer cells from growing or kill the cancer cells. <strong>Galena Biopharma Inc. (GALE)</strong> a small biotechnology company based in Lake Oswego, OR develops targeted biotherapeutics for cancer patients. Its lead therapy candidate, NeuVax, began enrollment earlier this year in a Phase III trial under the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Special Protocol Assessment as an adjuvant therapy for women having the protein human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/breast-cancer/AN00495"">(HER2-)</a> that are not eligible for Herceptin. HER2 is a protein that promotes the growth of cancer cells. HER2+ is a more aggressive type of breast cancer than HER-, but accounts for only 25% of the breast cancer patients. Herceptin, which was developed by Genentech, a subsidiary of the Swiss Pharmaceutical giant Roche (RHHBY.OB), is prescribed to women with the less common but more aggressive HER2+. Galena's NeuVax, an E75 peptide derived from HER2 combined with the immune adjuvant granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), is focused on the HER2-, which accounts for about 50% of the breast cancer sufferers. NeuVax stimulates CD8+ T cells to target cells having the HER2- protein expression. Roche's Herceptin sales are $1.66 billion annually, and that only accounts for 25% of the breast cancer patients. If NeuVax receives FDA approval in treating treat low to intermediate HER2- negative patients it could find itself with a drug as financially successful, if not more so than Herceptin.</p><p>Galena stock has had an excellent run, up 257% YTD. However, in the past week of trading it has given up over 17% of its price, largely due to overall market sentiment, which may provide for good entries at current prices for this promising biotech. On November 13th Galena posted a net loss for <a href=""http://www.nasdaq.com/article/galena-biopharma-reports-third-quarter-2012-financial-results-20121113-00273"">Q3 2012</a> of $6.3 million, or $0.09 per share. Net loss for the first nine months of 2012 came in at $31.2 million, or $0.52 per share. Galena is trading at $1.67 per share; meanwhile analysts' consensus has the target price at $5 per share. This stock appears to be oversold and undervalued. If NeuVax Phase III interim data is indicative of possible solid topline results, the share price will likely respond and meet, or likely even exceed the analysts' target price; therefore I see this stock as a buy.</p><p><strong>LTSL Chemotherapy Drug Administration</strong></p><p><strong>Celsion Corporation (CLSN)</strong> an oncology drug development company based out of Lawrenceville, NJ, has developed a <a href=""http://celsion.com/pages/technology"">new delivery system</a> using Lysolipid Thermally Sensitive Liposomes (LTSL) to deliver a cancer fighting drug. The LSTL's are filled with doxorubicin, a proven chemotherapy agent, and is then delivered intravenously and pared with radio frequency ablation that produces a slightly above normal body temperature which causes the LTSL membrane to melt releasing the Doxorubicin at the tumor site. The company's most advances clinical candidate is called ThermoDox and is being developed for treating liver cancer for patients not eligible for surgery. If clinicals continue to prove promising, ThermoDox could be one of the next big cancer fighting drugs, especially when one considers that there are roughly 750,000 new cases of liver cancer diagnosed annually, and The World Health Organization predicts that by 2020 <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/20/us-celsion-thermodox-idUSBRE85J0RT20120620"">liver cancer will be the No. 1</a> cancer in the world, overtaking Lung cancer. What's interesting about ThermoDox is the company is not developing a new chemotherapy drug but a new way of delivering a proven chemotherapy. ThermoDox is in a Phase III trial consisting of 700 patients with primary liver cancer, and the company hopes to have topline data by January 2013. ThermoDox has already been given priority status by health regulators in the United States and elsewhere, and if the data proves positive and the approval process moves along without delays Celsion believes it could see ThermoDox, its first drug, approved by the end of 2013.</p><p>Once Phase III data is released, Celsion will be looking for licensing deals with companies to sell ThermoDox in Asia, Europe and emerging markets. Though the company plans to market ThermoDox in the U.S. itself, Michael Tardugno CEO of Celsion also sees that positive data may lead to serious discussion about licensing the drug in the U.S. too. <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/20/us-celsion-thermodox-idUSBRE85J0RT20120620"">Mr. Tardugno</a> commented on possible licensing deals, &quot;There's more than one multi-national company ... that have initiated diligence.&quot; ThermoDox is also in Phase II studies consisting of up to 109 patients with recurrent <a href=""http://celsion.com/docs/pipeline_overview"">breast cancer</a> that has spread to the patient's chest wall. Phase II builds on positive Phase I studies which demonstrated strong evidence of either stable disease, partial response or complete response.</p><p>Celsion is a $231 million market cap company, and has seen its stock jump 288% YTD. On November 12th the company posted a net loss of $6.0 million, or $0.18 per share. For the first nine months of 2012 the company reported a net loss of $18.3 million, or $0.55 per share, compared to a net loss of $17.1 million, or $0.72 per share, in the same period of 2011 R&amp;D costs dropped roughly $1.9 million to $3.5 million Q3 as opposed to $5.4 million in Q3 of 2011. In August Griffin Securities, who has a buy rating on Celsion, raised its 12 month target price from $10 to $18 per share. Given the positive results of ThermoDox, and its possible use for a wider array of cancers including breast and pancreatic cancers, if ThermoDox is approved by the FDA this stock could easily exceed the target price. Though I am bullish on Celsion's stock, I do urge caution at this time the company is not making a profit so if there are delays in the approval it could have a negative effect on the stock price.</p><p><strong>Radiogel Targeted Radiotherapy Administration</strong></p><p><strong>Advanced Medical Isotope Corp. (ADMD.OB)</strong>, a microcap company based in Kennewick, WA is one of the few companies filling the void for the much needed and short supply of medical isotopes in the U.S. However, it is also developing a new method of delivering cancer fighting isotopes as a means to fight cancer through radiotherapy. The promising therapy is called <a href=""http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2012/04/10/472772/251532/en/AMIC-Obtains-Exclusive-License-for-Injectable-Radiogel-for-High-Dose-Interstitial-Radiation-Therapy.html"">Radiogel</a>, which ADMD obtained through a licensing agreement with Battelle Memorial Institute, a private non-profit science and technology development company. Radiogel is a biodegradable polymer that delivers Yttrium-90 microspheres directly into the tumor as an injection. What makes Radiogel most interesting is how it targets cancer cells by keeping the radioactive isotopes localized in one area, thereby keeping systemic exposure to a minimum. When the polymer is injected to the targeted cancer site it is in a liquid form. However, once the polymer warms to body temperature, it transforms into a gel trapping Yttrium-90 microspheres in place allowing the high energy beta particles to irradiate the cancer cells in the targeted tumor. Being able to predominantly target the cancer cells, Radiogel has been able to maximize the overall radiation dose to the targeted area with little of the radiation reaching nearby healthy tissue. One of the exciting aspects of this targeted method is that since it can be administered with an injection or during surgery. Therefore, the therapy can be delivered to cancer tumors that normally could not be removed surgically from the patient's body. Radiogel is designed to treat radiation-resistant solid cancers and has applications for cancers of the brain, liver, kidney and pancreas, and appears to be promising for tumors in the eye. Advanced Medical Isotope Corp. estimates that once Radiogel is on the market sales should reach between 5-15 million, with future sales estimated in excess of 75-100 million. Any updates on its regulatory process will likely garner the company much attention, especially if a timeframe on clinicals is mentioned.</p><p>Advanced Medical Isotope Corp. is a nano cap company with a $13.8 million market cap. Its stock is up almost 80% YTD yet still might be a bargain as in the last three months the stock has slipped somewhat. Today it trades just below $0.18 per share and appears to have found its bottom and has been on a slight upward trend rising 20% in the last month or so. Being a true nano cap company with no real earnings, this stock will move up or down dramatically on positive or negative news and thus can be a very volatile investment, as shown by its low steady volume followed by spikes upward in volume. However, this little company has potential to move upward on news of either of its two catalysts - producing and delivering medical isotopes, and its Radiogel technology. And though I do like that there is a much demand for a U.S. medical isotope producer, and once operational should produce revenue for the company, it's the future of Radiogel technology that piques my investment interest. Radiogel, once on the market, seems to have great earning potential and might interest a larger biopharmaceutical company to either partner up or buy out the company. Therefore, I see Advanced Medical Isotope Corp. as a buy at this price level.</p><p>Above I briefly summarized three companies that I believe could provide investors with solid gains if upcoming clinical data or other events indicate hope in these companies' product lines. Each of these companies should be considered as development-phase with the obvious associated risks of poor data or poor financials, either of which could impact share price negatively. However, the upside potential for each of these is good with any positive reported developments. Interested shareholders should consider the companies' charts, current financials, pipeline progression and targeted market groups and then make comparisons to each of the companies' market capitalization and ascertain if and why type of investment to make in these promising biotechs. As targeted cancer therapies are further validated, all of these companies' share prices may appreciate by association. However, I believe each of these has more to offer than just by being part of a sector of growing, targeted therapies. I believe each of these can possibly provide for significant gains from current levels via its own merit. Each was worthy of my research, and I believe is worthy of other investors' consideration with many upcoming catalysts likely coming from each.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[ADMD.OB]], [[GALE]], [[CLSN]].

With the financing out of the way, investors are free to look past the immediate risk and concentrate on the release of interim results from the ongoing Phase II ICT-107 trial, which can be expected to start trickling out within a year.</p><p>Immunocellular has also benefited from a general resurgence in the cancer immunotherapy sector as a whole. Thanks to a <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-dndn-the-surge-continues"">resurgence</a> in the Dendreon (DNDN) share price as the result of rebounding Provenge sales, companies such as CellDex Therapeutics (CLDX), Cel-Sci Corp (CVM) and Oncothyreon (ONTY) - in addition to Immunocellular - have all seen their share prices rise during the opening weeks of 2012.</p><p>As potential investors investigate the sector again, IMUC has certain benefits that carry more potential than what even Provenge has brought to the table.

Since it was issues of cost and reimbursement that led to a Dendreon <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.com/blog/article/-the-dndn-blood-bath-could-immunocellular-s-technology-offer-an-assist-"">death spiral</a> last summer, it's safe to assume that Immunocellular will not encounter those woes.</p><p>These positive factors could have contributed to the decision by Ayer Capital to become a significant holder of IMUC stock this year, now with a <a href=""http://xml.10kwizard.com/filing_raw.php?repo=tenk&amp;ipage=8007357"">seven percent</a> total position. As discussed earlier, Ayer is one of the better known healthcare-related hedge funds and holds - or has held - positions in many of the better-known companies in the healthcare/biotech sectors, such as Teva (TEVA), Dendreon , Celgene (CELG) and Oncothyreon .</p><p>All of these recent developments and the push towards two dollars makes IMUC a stock to watch.</p><p>Keep watching for developments.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[CVM]].</p>"
"586231","2012-05-14 08:15:01","Neostem: Trio Of Catalysts?","<p><img src=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2012/5/14/saupload_nbs.png"" align=""right"" hspace=""6"" vspace=""6"" />On April 23rd, I wrote an <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/517701-neostem-investing-in-the-potential-success-of-cell-therapy"">article</a> in which I discussed cell therapy, an industry that I suggested as becoming a major provider of growth in biotechnology. I specifically focused on a small company, NeoStem (NBS), which I described as being misunderstood and with unrealized potential because of its diversified business structure. To my surprise, the stock has since returned a gain of 15%, which basically means that I regret not buying the stock. Yet over the last week, while I was away on vacation, I received a number of emails in regards to the company and its operations. The majority were questions regarding cell therapy, the company's cell manufacturing business, and how the company could profit from the advances of this technology. Therefore, I have written this article as a way to answer the collective questions regarding NeoStem, its business, but more specifically cell manufacturing.</p><p>In my previous article, I made it very clear that this particular business can be quite confusing. The reason I first mentioned NeoStem is because I think it is one step ahead of all other biotechnology companies in the progression of a therapy that has the potential to change the medical community. This particular company has the potential to return enormous profits, in part due to other companies' efforts to profit from the newfound advancements of cell therapy. Before we get into how NeoStem can benefit from recent advances and newfound emphasis on cell therapy, let's break down its business, which I already said can be confusing.</p><p>The best way to look at NeoStem is to break its primary <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/operating-divisions.html"">segments</a> into four parts:</p><ol><li><em>Regenerative medicine segment which includes VSEL Technology platform. This is an area of future emphasis which the company believes will change everything about cell therapy. It's definitely more research oriented but is important to the future advancements of the field.</em></li><li><em>Recently acquired Amorcyte and a Phase II candidate, AMR-001, for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction for which enrollment of a Phase II study in the United States commenced in January.</em></li><li><em>Over 50% ownership in Suzhou Erye Pharmaceutical Company, a generic pharmacy company, for which NeoStem has reportedly hired a financial advisor to assist in selling its stake in the company. Some have valued NeoStem's stake to be more than its current market cap.</em></li><li><em>Cell therapy contract manufacturing business, Progenitor Cell Therapy ((PCT))</em></li></ol><p>The combined segments of NeoStem's business provide the company with substantial value. The company has already <a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/e/120320/nbs10-k.html"">stated</a> that it's exploring the generic pharmacy business and that interested buyers do exist. By selling this segment, it could provide <a href=""http://secfilings.com/searchresultswide.aspx?TabIndex=2%26FilingID=8494705%26companyid=6286%26ppu=%252fdefault.aspx%253fticker%253dNBS"">enough cash</a> for the company to properly develop the studies of its Phase II drug, AMR-001, in which the manufacturing for the trial will be conducted by Progenitor Cell Therapy, the company's other segment which I believe is the most valuable of the company's assets.</p><p>NeoStem's cell therapy contract manufacturing business is perhaps the most confusing aspect of the company because, although complex, its other segments are somewhat self- explanatory. The manufacturing business performs work that we as investors are unfamiliar with and that has not been heavily publicized in biotechnology.</p><p>First, it's important to understand that cell therapy is primarily used in regenerative medicine, with the idea of creating a new organ, tissue, or cells. NeoStem contracts its services to manufacture cells on a large scale. The process is both difficult and very expensive for a company in the clinical phase, working on a product that requires the development of cells. NeoStem's business, PCT, has several locations. It is one of the <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/contract-manufacturing.html"">largest</a> in terms of manufacturing and capacity, and has a staff of very experienced individuals who have been working on the manufacturing of cells for many years prior to its recent headlines in the news. For example, companies that need cell products, or that are working on a developmental candidate, may not want to build their own manufacturing facility or train their own staff. Therefore, arrangements are made with NeoStem which then develops cells for various candidates and has the ability to manufacture all candidates.</p><p>The reason I originally looked at the company is because of its manufacturing business and my belief that there will be a growing demand for this industry that will significantly outperform the market over the next 10 years. NeoStem's business is among the best (and possibly the best) in the space, having <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/contract-manufacturing.html"">manufactured</a> over 30,000 products. I think it is very possible that cell therapies become a standard of care for a multitude of diseases and that NeoStem stands ready to benefit. It simply doesn't make sense for a developmental company that needs cell products to create its own product because of the risks involved with hiring and costs. This is the primary reason that high-profile companies in this space, such as Baxter (BAX) and Dendreon (DNDN) have chosen to use NeoStem's services for the manufacturing of its products.</p><p>The growth potential for the company's various segments lies, perhaps, most in its manufacturing. The company's lead candidate, <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/clinical-development/amr-001.html"">AMR-001</a>, is very similar to the late-stage Baxter candidate that NeoStem just so happens to be manufacturing. The manufacturing presents so much upside potential because of the backend revenue generated upon the approval of candidates that were helped to develop. NeoStem is now working with a number of different companies; if several of these companies are awarded an FDA approval, there could be significant revenue for NeoStem, which would be converted mostly into income.</p><p>As with most development phase biotechs there are two issues that may concern investors not accustomed to the biotech investment mindset, money and speculation. The first problem, money, is one of the primary reasons that the stock has been pushed lower over the last year. Just recently, in March, the stock was trading at $0.60 but then fell to $0.30. The reason for the decline being a round of <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/neostem-announces-pricing-public-offering-131151297.html"">financing</a> to raise money, which is normal and necessary on behalf of most developmental biotechnology companies. What I find to be encouraging is the fact that NeoStem is shopping the generic pharmacy business. Of course, I don't know how long it will take to sell the business but, upon completion, it should provide enough cash to stabilize the company and allow it to move forward on the execution of more important ventures.</p><p>The second problem also relates to financing: The company is speculative, though it has potential upside. I do believe that all developmental biotechnology companies are speculative and, I am not concerned with this as this is the very nature of a small pharmaceutical company, it's the risk you take to invest in the space. The stocks had a lot of selling pressure as of late, but I think people forget the value of its generic pharmacy business along with the fact that NeoStem reported over $70 million in revenue in 2011, despite being a developmental biotechnology company. The company has a Phase II candidate that is <a href=""http://www.baxter.com/press_room/press_releases/2012/02_28_12_stem_cell_cmi.html"">strikingly similar</a> to Baxter's candidate, which is being manufactured at NeoStem's facility, and is a major advantage for NeoStem. I believe the largest upside lies in the manufacturing business and the company's ability to capitalize on a growing demand for cell therapies that have recently become the focal point for a long line of medical research. At this time, the company is working with several late-stage candidates; if approved, the company can hopefully lock the drugs into long-term contracts and return large revenues from sales for many years to come.</p><p>The business structure to NeoStem is complex and can be confusing for those who are accustomed to the standard of biotechnology companies. NeoStem definitely has its hand in several different segments of business and has managed to return decent revenue because of its diversification. I really like the moves the company is making and feel as though it's on the right path. The PCT business has been <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/clinical-development/amr-001.html"">manufacturing</a> cells for many years. It must be enlightening for investors to see that the industry of cell therapies is gaining so much momentum: NeoStem now has its own late-stage candidate ad is among the best at knowing how to effectively create the best cell therapies. The PCT capacities and revenue, the Amorcyte phase II drug and the potential money from the pending sale of Suzhou Erye Pharmaceuticals are all reasons investors will begin to more closely monitor the budding stem cell biotech.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: The information in this article is for educational purposes only and should not be used to make any investment decisions.</em></p>"
"844281","2012-09-04 09:34:17","A Gold Mine In Biotechnology: The Companies Poised To Benefit","<p>In a recent explained on the popular site <em>Nature</em>, there was discussion on immunotherapy, which has become a crucial aspect in the treatment of cancer. Immunotherapy is the likely future of cancer treatment, and companies are creating more advanced therapies to tackle the disease via the immunotherapy approach. In the <em>Nature</em> issue, the importance of the immune system and immunotherapy is explained:</p><blockquote class=""quote""><p>The tumour microenvironment is an important aspect of cancer biology that contributes to tumour initiation, tumour progression, and responses to therapy. Cells and molecules of the immune system are a fundamental component of the tumour microenvironment. Importantly, therapeutic strategies can harness the immune system to specifically target tumour cells, and this is particularly appealing owing to the possibility of inducing tumour-specific immunological memory, which might cause long-lasting regression and prevent relapse in cancer patients.</p></blockquote><p>The study and practice of immunotherapy is still relatively new, as we have only scratched the surface of its potential. It has been about 2&frac12; years since Dendreon (DNDN) was awarded the first approval of an immunotherapy for Provenge&reg;, and was trading with a valuation in excess of $5 billion. The space has since evolved, and now there are many candidates in clinical studies, or that are in line to be approved, and that are much more advanced, returning better results, and have effectively learned how to harness the immune system and target specific tumor cells. As a result of the innovation and evolution of immunotherapies, those suffering with cancer are seeing much better results and, in time, it is possible that companies may learn to harness the power of the immune system to fight other diseases besides just cancer.</p><p>In the past, companies and physicians believed that in order to fight cancer they would need harsh treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery in order to succeed. But after decades of little progress, success is being found in immunotherapy -- a strategy that may have seemed comical in the past. Of course, like all areas of treatment, there are certain pioneers of the space. There are certain companies that are pushing the envelope, and are years ahead of everyone else. These companies are building on the innovation of Dendreon, creating therapies that could possibly treat numerous diseases, all the while possibly returning billions in revenue as the conventional treatments of old are replaced. Let's take a look at a few of these therapies that are pushing the envelope with encouraging clinical trials that have large market potential and should prove to be a win for companies, patients, and investors. And what's even more encouraging is that it's not only the big pharma companies commanding this space, but also small companies with innovative drugs that should return enormous gains for several stocks over the next several years.</p><p><strong>Large Pharma in Late Stage Development</strong></p><p>For an approach as promising as immunotherapy it makes sense that large pharma would already have a strong presence in the development of promising, blockbuster-potential candidates. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) made its presence known in the immunotherapy field after its success with Yervoy for the treatment of metastatic melanoma earned an FDA approval in March 2011. The drug, which is <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/business/26drug.html"">the first</a> to prolong the lives of people with this particular cancer, <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/melanoma-skin-cancer/news/20110325/fda-approves-new-melanoma-treatment-yervoy"">extends</a> the lives of those who have exhausted other treatment options for metastatic melanoma by 10 months. For many, 10 months may not sound long, but when compared to the average of just 6.4 months in the control group of the Yervoy trial, it shows a very significant advantage considering that success in many cancers is measured in just months or even weeks at times. Therefore, in addition to Provenge, Yervoy is yet another step in the right direction for the future of immunotherapy, and is an example of yet another condition that immunotherapy is conquering.</p><p>In regards to other large pharma companies, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Amgen (AMGN), and Novartis (NVS) are all developing late stage immunotherapy products. GlaxoSmithKline is <a href=""http://www.fiercevaccines.com/special-reports/10-promising-therapeutic-vaccines/mage-a3-10-promising-therapeutic-vaccines"">using</a> a mixture of proteins to boost the body's immune system in an attempt to fight a variety of cancers that express the MAGE-A3 antigen. The company's latest trial is in metastatic melanoma, similar to Yervoy, and will target a specific audience, as melanoma is a disease that companies are trying desperately to fight with its large market potential. Amgen's <a href=""http://www.fiercebiotech.com/special-reports/10-promising-late-stage-cancer-drugs/oncovex-10-promising-late-stage-cancer-drugs"">candidate</a>, formerly OncoVex, is yet another in Phase III to treat melanoma. Novartis, however, is working with Transgene, and has an <a href=""http://www.4-traders.com/TRANSGENE-4789/news/TRANSGENE-Updates-on-the-Therapeutic-Vaccine-TG4010-Developed-in-Lung-Cancer-13863142/"">exclusive option</a> to in-license TG4010 based on its Phase IIb/III trial for patients with advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ((NSCLC)). This provides a focus outside metastatic melanoma for large pharma companies.</p><p><strong>Developmental Biotech with Most Promising Immunotherapies</strong></p><p>Obviously Pfizer (PFE) did not become a dominant force in the biotechnology arena overnight. It has been a long and tedious journey for the company, and like all large pharma companies, it has had to continue to evolve and grow its pipeline and earn FDA approvals with products that return sales in the billions. One of the more common methods of growth for the large and dominant biotech companies is to grow through acquisitions. Already having impressive profits due to higher margin drug sales, large pharmaceuticals have the privilege of operating with large cash positions for high-profile acquisitions. In fact, most of the large pharma companies developing immunotherapy candidates are the result of acquisitions. Since drugs such as Yervoy and Provenge return strong sales, and other candidates in the field also surpass standard of care in clinical trials, investors should expect that high profile candidates of developmental stage companies could be acquired. In biotechnology, especially among the large companies in the space, it's a race to determine which company can acquire the best, most innovative drugs to gain an edge on the competition. It can be inferred that the following clinical stage companies will most likely be acquired for large premiums at some point in the future due to clinical results that are separating these candidates from the others in the field. However, it may be possible for these companies to elect to grow on the success of their immunotherapy, starting the journey of possibly becoming the next Pfizer. Following are rising immunotherapy stars in the biotech sector that could be the next acquisition targets, or could be early stage big pharma in the making:</p><p>One of the most high-profile targets of developmental companies with immunotherapy candidates has been glioblastoma multiforme ((GBM)), and <strong>Celldex Therapeutics (CLDX)</strong> is the most advanced in terms of clinical studies. The company's candidate, CDX-110, has been <a href=""http://ypekakapu.wordpress.com/2012/01/16/celldex-therapeutics-receives-fast-track-designation-for-cdx-110-a-novel-egfrviii-vaccine-for-glioblastoma/"">granted</a> Fast Track designation for the Phase III study in patients presenting the EGFRvIII gene. Although CDX-110 is the most advanced, and will probably earn an FDA approval, <strong>ImmunoCellular Therapeutics</strong> <strong>(IMUC)</strong> has a Phase II candidate, ICT-107, which is by far the most promising, with half of the patients treated with the vaccine still alive after four years. This is impressive considering only 6% live three years with standard care alone. Meanwhile, 38.5% of the patients treated with ICT-107 saw no progression of the disease at three years. As a result, ICT-107 may be the most promising of any immunotherapy. Both ICT-107 and CDX-110 are taking great strides via the immunotherapy approach proving that even the formidable GBM can be effectively treated by this approach.</p><p><strong>Galena Biopharma (GALE),</strong> in my opinion, presents the greatest investment opportunity with the most upside potential. The company's lead candidate, NeuVax, showed a 50% reduction in breast cancer recurrence in a 200 patient Phase II trial. In its Phase III trial, it will be testing 700-1,000 patients, but the trial will only test for the indication in which NeuVax has already been proven to be effective. As a result, there is a great likelihood of success, as it's only targeting patients with low to intermediate levels of HER2, which represents a very significant share of total breast cancer patients. The reason I believe it presents the most upside is because it is a $110 million company, with a vaccine proven effective on its targeted subgroup, which has sales potential similar to Herceptin, a drug that returned $6 billion in 2011. With this being said, GALE presents a great opportunity in the immunotherapy space, with a candidate that effectively treats a large unmet medical need. Success in the phase II trial and the large targeted treatment group are most likely why the stock has increased in value by nearly 250% in 2012, making it one of the most promising immunotherapies in development.</p><p><strong>NewLink Genetics (NLNK)</strong> is breaking the barriers of treatment with its HyperAcute Pancreas Phase III FDA Fast Track candidate. NewLink is a fairly new company to the market; but with an immunotherapy candidate that <a href=""http://www.dddmag.com/news/2012/05/hyperacute-pancreas-meets-trial-endpoint"">observed</a> 12 month disease free survival ((DFS)) of 62% and median DFS of 14.1 months in a Phase II trial, it also looks poised to be yet another company with significant upside potential that should garnish interest from large pharma-- especially considering the size of its pipeline and its large target patient group potential as well. The early success in the pancreatic cancer indication is particularly impressive considering that the one-year and five-year overall survival rates are 24% and 5%, respectively. The Phase III trial is being evaluated under a Special Protocol Assessment ((SPA)) with the FDA which provides guidance for the trial design and helps to determine endpoints, which if met, would all but guarantee regulatory approval.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>In closing, investors should expect great results and highly profitable drugs from large pharma; and from the developmental phase biotech companies, you could expect similar results and possible acquisitions. The exciting fact is that this is one space not solely controlled by large companies, but where small companies are just as innovative as the better-known names of the space. My belief is that we are entering a new era of cancer treatment; and with the space <a href=""http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/sns-rt-us-immunotherapybre846047-20120506,0,6545497.story"">expected</a> to grow to $75 billion by 2015, there is plenty of room for each company on this list to experience success. With current results, I anticipate that most, if not all, on this list will see approvals in the near future, and that the small companies will return enormous gains to investors in either fundamental growth or by being purchased prior to approvals. These prospects present great opportunities over a course of several years for investors regardless of our country's economic conditions or market headwinds.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[GALE]], [[IMUC]], [[AMGN]].

"429151","2012-03-13 04:08:54","Galena Looks Undervalued Considering Cancer Therapy Results","<p>Galena Biopharma's (GALE) spin-off of RXi (RXII) Pharmaceuticals has caused a great deal of concern and confusion, among investors. The level of volatility has been at an all-time high for this stock as investors try and determine what, if any, impact the spin-off will have on GALE. There have been several opinions, including articles with various opinions, and history into the background of the company. As an investor who has a passion for biotechnology, I aim to provide a look at the spin-off and what it could mean for the company. I currently do not own any shares in GALE, but think that at the current price per share, it may be a good time to initiate a long position.</p><p>First, a little background information. Galena Biopharma is a biotechnology company that utilizes immunotherapy, in which its lead candidate, <a href=""http://neuvax.com/data.html"">NeuVax</a> (E75), is a phase III drug that treats breast cancer in patients that are not eligible for Roche-Genentech's (RHHBY.PK) Herceptin. The science behind NeuVax is that it uses a person's own immune system to fight the cancerous disease. It successfully activates, locates, and then destroys the cancerous cells without affecting healthy cells. The problem with other cancer treatments has been the inability to treat the &quot;root&quot; of the problem, which results in high recurrence rates. NeuVax, which achieved its primary endpoint of disease free survival, has shown encouraging results. NeuVax was granted a Special Protocol Assessment (<a href=""http://investors.galenabiopharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=641187"">SPA</a>) for a phase III clinical trial in adjuvant therapy of women with low-to-intermediate (also known as HER2-Negative, not eligible for Herceptin) status, by the FDA.</p><p>The company's spin-off and involvement with RXi Pharmaceuticals and CytRx (CYTR) is causing a significant amount of unnecessary confusion among investors. The bottom line is that Galena was created after RXi Pharmaceuticals purchased Apthera (NeuVax) for $7.1 million. GALE purchased the drug and decided to focus on immunotherapy because it was a late stage candidate that had shown promise and was incredibly cheap, due to Apthera being in financial distress. As a result, GALE was created and the spin-off will result in all Galena investors being issued new shares of RXi Pharmaceuticals, however the internal pieces of the spin-off and what it means for the future of both companies has come under fire as of late, due to questions over which company will have &quot;control.&quot;</p><p>I think it's a good idea to clarify a few of the issues affecting investor sentiment. First, I believe the spin-off is good for Galena Biopharma, as the company will now be able to focus on cancer treatments, and its CEO Mark Ahn will be able lead Galena by dedicating all of his attention to the treatment of cancer without any ties to RXI. The question of whether or not GALE will be tied to either RXI or CytRx has been of major concern to some. However, I don't see why there is any need to be concerned about CytRx's ownership in GALE. GALE is an independent company, and not a subsidiary of CytRx, as many people believe. In fact, they don't own any shares of GALE, or the new RXI, and have no say in any decision of either company.</p><p>After looking at the spin-off and the worries of investors I cannot find what is so confusing or debated among investors. I understand that there is an assumption that GALE will still be controlled by either Cytrx or RXI, but it's simply not true. The assumption is derived from the acquisition of &quot;NeuVax&quot; back when Galena was created, and the belief that previous shareholders would have a say in how GALE dictates its business. However, it's simply not the case, and investors should be pleased that RXI made the decision to acquire a phase III ready asset for a cheap price because the parent company was in financial distress. It's a common method used by big pharma, to purchase distressed assets for a cheap price, but when a small company such as RXI finds a similar deal it's frowned upon by the investment community.</p><p>The bottom line is that NeuVax is still the most advanced breast cancer vaccine under development and is 100% owned by GALE. The spin-off is necessary, and is good for investors, because it will make Galena stronger than ever, without any ties to CytRx or RXi. In fact, the spin-off is a great opportunity for investors to diversify into two technologies, GALE shares that are already owned and new RXI shares as a dividend. After the spin-off, there will be around 55 million new shares of RXI issued to Galena investors, representing an 8% stake in the company. Most likely, the RXi shares will open at a very low valuation, however the RNAi technology does have potential, and is almost like an IPO in which GALE investors will have a head start. Overall, I see very little if any downside to the spinoff and believe it will finally free the company and allow GALE to exclusively focus on its treatment, which is showing such early promise. The current status of NeuVax appears encouraging, and by all measures the company looks to be undervalued considering the results.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in [[GALE]] over the next 72 hours.</p>"
"1309761","2013-03-31 01:33:38","The 'Blitz': Looking At Individual Stocks Presenting Value","<p>Last week's &quot;Blitz&quot; created great discussions as each week the number of questions submitted grow. This week I am looking at the best stock-specific questions. I will continue to take questions through Seeking Alpha, <a href=""http://nicholstoday.com/"">NicholsToday.com</a>, or through <a href=""https://twitter.com/bnichols9883"">Twitter</a> in the week prior to future postings. This week's questions cover broad topics. Therefore, I hope you enjoy, learn, and at the end feel free to chime in.</p><p><a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1296671-the-blitz-are-these-stocks-presenting-upside"">Last week's &quot;Blitz&quot; can be found here</a></p><p><i>ValueSeeker2013</i> asks, &quot;<b>Technically, Sprint (S) looks as though it could break out from an ascending triangle. The volume and Bollinger bands have also expanded, but my question is if you are fundamentally bullish? I am not a fundamental investor and I know that last year you were bullish on the stock.</b></p><p>While you are not a fundamental investor, I am in no way a technical trader. I was bullish on Sprint, but not anymore. However, I cannot speak to whether or not it will break out and trade higher technically; yet I do believe that it is no longer presenting clear value.</p><p>Back when I said it was a &quot;buy&quot;, Sprint had begun selling the iPhone and had been fundamentally beaten down by AT&amp;T (T) and Verizon (VZ) due to it not being able to sell the iPhone in years prior. Therefore, when Sprint gained rights to the iPhone, and was priced at $2.30 versus $5.00 in the year prior, I viewed it as a value too strong to ignore.</p><p>Now, fast forward. Is the stock good now? My answer is no. It has appreciated to the level in which I predicted and the landscape has changed. There are now more than 10 carriers with the iPhone, versus only three when Sprint began selling it. At this point of the investment it becomes a question of efficiency, and whether or not the company can achieve profitability. In my opinion, it won't happen anytime soon. The company, with a $4.3 billion net loss, has too large of a hole - and with it trading at a 50% discount to Verizon on a price/sales basis I think it is fairly valued. Like I said, you may be able ride it higher-however I think there is better value elsewhere.</p><p>NicholsToday user, skelton asks, &quot;<b>You called OncoSec Medical (ONCS.OB) your next GALE, but what is that you think can propel this stock higher by 200-300%?&quot;</b></p><p>First off, I didn't say that it was the next GALE; I said that it was sparking my interest as a company with a lot of catalysts. Although it may not be a favorable comparison, Celsion Corporation (CLSN) went from a $70 million market cap to a near $300 million cap on data that appeared good, but that had lingering questions. For example, there were real concerns that ThermoDox did not treat distant tumors, and some worried that because cancer does not always regrow in the same area that it would prove ineffective in a larger trial. Turns out, these concerns were right, but where I find OncoSec interesting is with distant response, as more than 50% of patients treated with ImmunoPulse had a distant response.</p><p>Obviously, what drives a biotechnology stock is catalysts/data, and OncoSec has perhaps the most data-packed year of any company in the space. So far the company has had no negative data, but has not appreciated due to the fact that investors are unaware of its existence. I think that will change, as the company announces data for three Phase 2 programs, advances into later trials, and gains a possible Orphan status for its Merkel Cell Carcinoma ((MCC)) treatment, due to there being no other studies on the disease. In addition to data also comes meetings with the FDA, enrollment news, patents news, etc., which are all catalysts in biotech. Finally, I think that as investors assess the company, and if it can continue to show a distant response (along with a local response), investors will become interested. Although there is not enough information to know if the product will see an eventual approval, I think that this collection of events could come together to create very nice gains.</p><p><i>Sabron</i> asks, &quot;<b>What is your short term price target after Arena Pharmaceuticals' (ARNA) Belviq launch</b>?&quot;</p><p>Americans love the idea of losing weight, but more importantly, we love the idea of losing weight without having to work too hard. Currently, in Amazon's bestselling books, two of the top five are weight-loss related. Thus, Americans are open to the idea of losing weight, but often begin and end diets quite rapidly.</p><p>In my opinion, there are a few factors that make Belviq an &quot;immediate&quot; success: It has no side effects, it has a great safety review, it will have flexible marketing abilities, and it is being launched on someone else's dime. Hence, I expect to see billboards, commercials, samples, etc. and for consumers to respond favorably to the prospects of losing weight by taking a pill.</p><p>My concerns with Belviq are if it will be a six-month wonder or if it will transcend the space and spend many years as a global growth drug. I think the <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/arena-pharmaceuticals-vivus-competitors-lucrative-122000087.html"">potential</a> is present with over 500 million people obese around the globe, with a large percentage being in the U.S. and in Europe. However, we must also fear that the weight loss craze will die down, and that sales will not sustain. The best example is GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Alli, and the craze that it created when it was FDA approved. In the first three days, Alli posted <a href=""http://voices.yahoo.com/alli-thoughts-popular-weight-loss-drug-1783833.html"">sales</a> of $12 million, and then $247.2 million in the <a href=""http://pharmamkting.blogspot.com/2009/06/weight-loss-drug-alli-on-life-support.html"">first year</a>. However, in 2008 (one-year after its launch), sales fell to $<a href=""http://pharmamkting.blogspot.com/2009/06/weight-loss-drug-alli-on-life-support.html"">131 million</a> as consumers left for the next best thing. This is the problem with weight loss products. Accordingly, I expect solid performance and sales during the first year (with no price target), but then I am not so certain about the year that follows.</p><p>Seeking Alpha user, <i>Kamiason</i>, asks <b>&quot;Is Zillow the Best Investment for the Housing Market?&quot;</b></p><p>Anyone who has ever read my articles, comments, or tweets about <b>Zillow (Z)</b> is aware that it is not my favorite stock. While I do admit that the company's growth is amazing, its services are tremendous, and its margins are relatively low to the competition (Trulia), my concern remains with valuation. This is a company that lists homes on a great platform, and then Realtors&reg; pay the company to be advertised on the site, next to homes-also called Marketplace revenues.</p><p>Zillow has managed to grow rapidly in a depressed housing market, and there is a belief that, as the housing market continues to rise, its fundamentals will boom as well. This may be true, but I am curious to see if agents determine that such advertising is necessary in a growing market. Currently, my wife and I are looking at new houses, and have found it more useful to drive to the houses for sale and then take the flyers inside of the Realtor's sign. We can then look at pictures on Zillow and use it as a line of research. However, we find the old school method of house hunting to be highly important. With that being said, I am curious how many people view &quot;house hunting&quot; like my wife and I, and I am curious to see if a new market will change the demand for Zillow's Marketplace. Perhaps it grows, but with a price/sales ratio of 16.00 and a forward P/E ratio of 68.40, I believe the risk is too high for such an uncertainty.</p><p>My favorite play for the housing market is banks. I think Zillow is too expensive with too many questions and the Home Depot (HD) continues to be a company with fundamental growth that underperforms its stock. I prefer a stock such as Bank of America (BAC). Besides trading at just 65% of its book value per share, the company just announced a <a href=""http://www.streetinsider.com/Stock+Buybacks/Bank+of+America+%28BAC%29+to+Buyback+$5B+in+Stock,+Redeem+$5.5B+in+Preferred/8186545.html"">massive buyback program</a> of up to $5 billion worth of common stock, and the redemption of up to $5.5 billion in preferred stock. Furthermore, the company has seen a much more aggressive level of institutional buying over the last six months as it continues to clean up its &quot;toxic&quot; assets. I know that banks are a touchy subject, but even after large gains the stock still looks to be one of the cheapest and most ready for a significant breakout due to a rise in the housing market.</p><p>Seeking Alpha user, <i>Cjhulin85</i>, asks, &quot;<b>As of 2/12 Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (SPPI) had short interest of 27,231,000, after its drop; do you think the short interest covered or do you think that shorts will hang around?</b></p><p>Over the last two weeks, I have received countless questions and comments regarding Spectrum, and this is what I consider the best of those questions. As of 2/28 more than 55% of its float was short, but seeing as how the stock fell it makes sense that shorts would move on to a better opportunity, right?

The reason that these stocks maintain high short interest is because most are highly profitable and trendy for shorts. So to answer your question, no, I do not think the losses will rid the stock of shorts. I think in order to eliminate the short interest the company must regain the trust of investors and produce significant growth with one of its three FDA-approved drugs. Other than that, I would consider the fact that at $7.00 Spectrum trades with the same price/sales ratio that it did at $12.00 before it lowered guidance. As a result, the stock is not really that cheap, and I'd be very careful investing at this point in time.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>If you have a question about any of the stocks I follow, a market-related question, or would like my opinion on a specific topic, please feel free to send me an email or provide feedback in the comments section below.

"488411","2012-04-10 10:39:52","Breaking The Mold Of Oncology Drug Development","<p>Advancements in research have reached a 30-year pinnacle. Cancer treatment has been, at best, a very slow process, with new technology that is slowly being welcomed by the FDA. One company in particular, ImmunoCellular Therapeutics (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/imuc.ob"">IMUC.OB</a>), is working diligently to break the mold of oncology drug development. As a result, I am looking at how the company is progressing the field, along with the past and present trends in oncology.</p><p>Looking at all oncology products on the market and how each work, it is striking to note how each <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/473161-cancer-vaccine-approaches-a-race-for-dominance-in-the-field"">targets</a> a single factor in the complex processes that control tumor growth and invasion. Cancer continues to evolve, yet there is a lack of any viable drugs on the market to effectively combat the disease. It is almost like one is attempting to stop traffic in a city by blocking a single avenue: It only slows down traffic but doesn't stop it completely. The clinical outcomes of the last 30 years of oncology research are very similar -- we know how to slow down progression of the disease but can't stop it from spreading and eventually killing the patient.</p><p>There are two main culprits as to why we have taken this path of attacking single antigens over the last few decades. The first is that a large number of these drugs were <a href=""http://janebovary.hubpages.com/hub/Advances-in-Cancer-Treatment"">initially</a> developed in academia, which is notorious for <a href=""http://janebovary.hubpages.com/hub/Advances-in-Cancer-Treatment"">emphasizing</a> publication of fundamental understanding of pathways, rather than trying to find a combination of drugs for a cure. The main reason being combination drugs may be harder to study and, more importantly, even harder to publish. The <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm103366.pdf"">other problem</a> is the regulatory one, whereby the FDA has emphasized studying the effect of each drug entity and doesn't have a clear regulatory <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm103366.pdf"">pathway</a> for combining 2-3 or more experimental drugs together.</p><p>Probably in every other industry, several changes to a product are made simultaneously in next generation products (for example TV or laptop or cell phone) while the drug industry tries to make small incremental changes which take, usually, 10-12 years to prove through a Phase III randomized trial that a certain drug works. The only exception to this case seems to be the vaccine industry where combining various targets (antigens) of a pathogenic agent are considered to be a superior design and have been more successful than single targets.</p><p>One company that is trying to break this mold of oncology drug development is Immunocellular Therapeutics, which is <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/473161-cancer-vaccine-approaches-a-race-for-dominance-in-the-field"">developing</a> ways to stimulate the body's own immune system simultaneously against multiple targets, a page stolen from the vaccine world. Each tumor cell <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_antigen"">has</a> hundreds of antigens that are expressed on the cell surface, however most are also shared with normal cells. A few antigens are different on these cancer cells, and while other companies are pursuing a <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/473161-cancer-vaccine-approaches-a-race-for-dominance-in-the-field"">strategy</a> of targeting only one of these many antigens, such as Dendreon (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/dndn"">DNDN</a>), IMUC's <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/473161-cancer-vaccine-approaches-a-race-for-dominance-in-the-field"">approach</a> is to target several antigens simultaneously. Going back to the problem of blocking the traffic, IMUC's approach is to close as many avenues as possible so traffic really comes to a halt, which makes it easier to treat the cancerous cells.</p><p>The early stage <a href=""http://www.imuc.com/pdf/2012/other/IMUC%20Corporate%20Presentation%202_2012.pdf"">clinical data</a> from Phase I seems to provide validation to this approach treat the cancerous cells. The <a href=""http://www.centerwatch.com/clinical-trials/results/new-therapies/nmt-details.aspx?CatID=685"">results</a> show 40% of patients treated in a small Phase I study had no progression of disease over 3 years in the most aggressive type of brain tumor, glioblastoma. Four years ago, late Senator Kennedy was <a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2008/05/kennedy_has_mal.html"">diagnosed</a> with glioblastoma, declined quickly, and passed away after 15 months, which is normal for those diagnosed with this vicious disease. The 3 year <a href=""http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110912005872/en/ImmunoCellular-Therapeutics-Announces-55-Survival-years-Phase"">disease free</a> survival for this cancer is only 5%, so to have a 40% survival rate is quite a high achievement even from a small trial.</p><p>Over the last few months, IMUC has <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/451551-immunocellular-therapeutics-patent-acquisition-paradigm-shift"">announced</a> a number of collaborations with leading medical centers such as Johns Hopkins to buy rights to additional cancer antigens and to combine those in its cocktail to create vaccines targeting multiple sites on cancer cells. With Phase II trial <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/411501-immunocellular-therapeutics-pending-catalysts-could-spark-share-price-run"">results</a> coming up next year along with additional indications, such as ovarian cancer, being initiated, a positive trial result from IMUC would be a big game changer in how we develop the next generation of drugs for cancer.</p><p>Since the beginning of this year, IMUC has seen a significant price appreciation on the back of accelerated <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/411501-immunocellular-therapeutics-pending-catalysts-could-spark-share-price-run"">enrollment</a> and aggressive technology acquisitions. If Amgen's (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/amgn"">AMGN</a>) acquisition of Biovax and Micromet (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/miti"">MITI</a>) are any indications of large pharma's willingness to acquire these products, for over a billion dollars based on Phase II data, then there is clearly a very significant upside if the trial results are positive for this seemingly transcendent technology.</p><p>The last thing that could add fuel to this story is the <a href=""http://www.hagan.senate.gov/files/TREAT_ACT_Background.pdf"">pending legislation,</a> Transforming the Regulatory Environment to Accelerate Access to Treatment Act (TREAT), proposed by Senator Hagan (D-NC) that is aimed at giving an accelerated approval for products like ICT-107, the product developed by IMUC, based on early stage trials where they have demonstrated dramatic response. This could bring ICT-107 to patients quickly while the company continues to accumulate additional data, and make a significant impact to the treatment of glioblastoma, a disease where only two new drugs have been approved over the last 30 years. As the treatment of cancer continues to evolve, and the targeting of multiple antigens becomes common, we should finally see the advancements in cancer that we are so desperate to witness, and IMUC is leading the charge.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/imuc.ob"">IMUC.OB</a>.</p><p><strong>Additional disclosure:</strong> The material in this article is for informational purposes only and should not be used to make any investment decisions.</p>"

This would ultimately lead to more focus and resources spent on the development of the company's stem cell applications for heart diseases, as well as other biotech products.</p><p>Digging deeper in the stem cell research field, I came to another theoretic possibility: NeoStem (NBS) is a perfect M&amp;A candidate for a Chinese company with international ambitions.</p><p><img src=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2012/5/28/saupload_nbs.jpg"" hspace=""6"" vspace=""6"" /></p><p><strong>Chinese Stem Cell Research</strong></p><p>China's output in fundamental stem cell research has increased markedly in recent years. Vigorous public investment and infrastructure development have enabled major productivity gains, but challenges in regulation, governance, and the management of clinical expectations must be addressed to ensure scientific quality and sustainable growth.</p><p>Although China's regulatory environment had previously been more accepting of cellular-based therapies, in December 2011, the Chinese Ministry of Health announced that companies using stem cells must register their clinical activities and asked local health authorities to halt unapproved use of stem cells in their regions. They also asked for a moratorium on new clinical trials and that patients in existing clinical trials should not be charged. As a result of this and other factors, NeoStem has determined to take steps to restrict (and expects to ultimately eliminate) its regenerative medicine business in China.</p><p><strong>Regulation</strong></p><p>China will halt new applications for clinical trials of stem cell products until July 1st as part of a year-long campaign to regulate the development of the industry, according to a Ministry of Health spokesman's statement in December 2011. Previously, China had one of the most unrestrictive embryonic stem cell research policies in the world.</p><p>In May of 2009, the Ministry of Health in China announced new regulations for the clinical application of stem cell therapies. These rules will require stem cell centers to provide evidence of the safety and efficacy of the therapies they offer, but these treatments are still available, as the government is working through the details of these regulations. Afterwards, the Ministry of Health will need to evaluate each available therapy according to the Ministry's new criteria, so it will be some time before we know what impact these new regulations have on the stem cell landscape in China. Whether China succeeds in overcoming the controversy around its stem cell clinics will largely depend on its ability to regulate them. The government's development of new clinical regulations show its commitment to changing the status quo of how these therapies are offered, but strict implementation of the new regulations will be required to quell international criticisms.</p><p><strong>Potential</strong></p><p>The Chinese government has rapidly built up its scientific capacity in regenerative medicine, including stem cells, tissue engineering, and gene therapy. China's success in this field is increasingly hard to deny: China is now the 5th largest publisher of peer-reviewed papers on stem cell research in the international scientific literature, shooting from 37 publications in 2000 up to 1,116 in 2008. Although still short of the United States' 6,008 stem cell publications in 2008, China's publication levels nearly match those of the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany.</p><p>China has adopted a four way approach to build its stem cell industry since 2007, including permissive policies on stem cells, recruiting back Chinese expatriates into local research, and providing annual funding of about $320 million. A more stringent regulatory system will allow Chinese institutions to sell products overseas.</p><p>How has China built its regenerative medicine field so quickly? The Chinese government has employed a highly successful four-pronged approach to building up regenerative medicine, combining a powerful recruitment strategy for researchers, ample funding, permissive regulations, and a focus on rapidly deriving applications.</p><p>Regenerative medicine therapies are an attractive solution to an increasing burden of chronic disease faced by China's large and aging population. Research in the field aspires to produce solutions to a number of chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and degenerative conditions associated with age. As a result, the Chinese government has identified it as a health research priority.</p><p>China has also strongly focused its research objectives towards generating therapeutic applications. Moreover, universities and hospitals have the tight relationships needed to understand patient needs and translate research from lab to clinic, making China a front-runner in the race to develop therapies.</p><p><strong>Investment Case</strong></p><p>It is time to start taking China seriously. China's progress in regenerative medicine has gone largely unnoticed because of the Western media's focus on stem cell tourism and other controversial facts around its stem cell clinics.</p><p>China has had setbacks, but if it keeps building on its strengths and overcoming its regulatory challenges, the country may stand at the forefront of the race to develop internationally recognized regenerative medicine treatments and therapies that patients desperately need everywhere around the globe.</p><p>This year will be important in how China's regulations affect the stem cell industry. In my opinion, the outcome will be positive and will lead the way for renewed focus and investments in the stem cell industry.</p><p>Big pharmaceuticals are urgently looking to buy up smaller firms to fill in their revenue gaps. In fact, for the past two years, M&amp;A activity in the biotech, pharma, and generics industries have hit record numbers. This has pushed premiums way up for smaller drug and biotech companies. Let's hope NeoStem can also profit from this trend.</p><p>In the <a href=""http://www.cowenlatitude.com/document/12q1_china_healthcare_ma.pdf"">quarterly report</a> of Cowen and Company Asia, you see the deal flow in China regarding Healthcare. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) made a big move in China earlier this month with the purchase of its first medical device company in that country. The company picked up Guangzhou Bioseal Biotech, which develops a porcine plasma-derived biologic product for controlling bleeding during surgery, for an undisclosed sum. J&amp;J has a growing portfolio of hemostasis products in China. The company could use NeoStem's distribution network in China.</p><p>Furthermore, the close relationship between NeoStem and Baxter (BAX) looks like a catalyst that could bring M&amp;A activity in the future. NeoStem's existing shareholders, such as RimAsia Capital Partners and Enhance Biomedical Holding Corp., could take the company private or cooperate with a Chinese merger opportunity.</p><p>The depressed stock price has potential to fly, so let China, and the Chinese, decide.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[NBS]].</p>"
"1044121","2012-12-04 13:06:02","5 Stocks With The Catalysts And Opportunity For Large Returns Over The Next Year","<p>In this volatile market there is value everywhere. In just about every industry you will find valuations that misalign with fundamentals, and stock trends that don't reflect future fundamentals. With that being said, I am looking at five of the top stocks presenting both value and significant upside potential. I am looking at stocks presenting the greatest level of value moving into 2013, all of which I believe will double in the year that lies ahead.</p><p>In the last three months, <strong>Seagate Technology (STX)</strong> has fallen lower regardless of key developments that come from the company. Investors have become worried due to continuous reports of further PC and laptop sales troubles. However, Seagate does not appear worried at all, the company recently <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/4939621-seagate-technology-plc-declares-and-increases-quarterly-cash-dividend-by-19"">increased its market leading yield by 19%</a>, now paying a forward yield of 6%, and continues to buyback shares aggressively.</p><p>In this market, a company paying a yield of 6% with 35% top line growth will not stay cheap long. The stock is currently priced at $25.10, if it were to double the stock would be just $15 greater than its current 52-week high. Therefore, Seagate's upside comes as a result of its current value. The company's risks simply aren't as great as some believe, and its upside is far greater.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, the company is much more than just a laptop/PC storage business; its hard disk drives are also used in home entertainment, DVRs, game consoles, and it also provides storage for the cloud. Therefore, the upside is great for this value investment, with a presence in several fast growing segments. I look for Seagate to provide large gains in the coming year, as funds rebalance and retail investors look for safety and security in high yield stocks. Seagate has everything that long-term dividend investors seek, and once it shows a little momentum, expect takeoff.</p><p><strong>Arena Pharmaceuticals (ARNA)</strong> has rallied 370% in 2012, yet is more than 30% off its 52 week high. The company's stock has remained volatile due to worse than expected sales of VIVUS' weight loss product and a slower than expected launch. Therefore, the stock has traded in a range between $7.50 and $9.30 since falling back from highs, but has several catalysts in the year ahead.</p><p>Looking into 2013 Arena will launch its weight loss drug Belviq. The expectations have fallen due to the struggles of VIVUS, but I expect a far greater commercial response, compared to VIVUS. The reason is because Arena does not face many of the same problems. VIVUS is forced to sell its product via mail order and can not market its product on TV, billboard, etc. Therefore, there are a lot of consumers who don't even know that an FDA approved weight loss product exists. Once Belviq is launched, we will see billboards, commercials, magazine ads, etc. as part of the drug's massive marketing campaign.</p><p>Overall, the weight loss market is so large that there is no reason Arena shouldn't be successful. The safety of its product should see much better adoption among physicians and should create optimism among shareholders. Of course this is speculation, but furthermore, the company will be moving forward to commercialize the product in Europe and will be <a href=""http://themarketsareopen.blogspot.com/2012/11/arna-arena-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqarna.html"">developing</a> another potentially billion dollar product temanogrel. I expect that the success of Belviq combined with the likelihood of European approval and the development of temanogrel will add significant value in 2013, and I wouldn't be surprised to see a price north of $15.</p><p><strong>XPO Logistics (XPO)</strong> is one of the best stories in the market that you most likely don't know. The company's stock has increased in value by 50% over the last year, and nearly 200% since Bradley Jacobs began his term as the company's CEO (following his <a href=""http://jpe.com/"">$150 million equity investment</a>). In 2012 the company has exceeded all of its own <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/963051-bradley-jacobs-talks-xpo-logistics-growth-outlook-and-turbo-it-s-a-home-run"">goals</a> with three acquisitions that equal $250 million of additional revenue (in 2013) and seven cold starts (two ahead of guidance).</p><p>The pure growth of this company is really hard to comprehend, especially in this market. XPO is being built as a company that will grow regardless of market conditions. The company's CEO, Jacobs, is aiming to build his fifth billion dollar company over the course of his career, and so far, he is on the right track.</p><p>In the last 12 months, XPO Logistics has posted revenue in the amount of $214.17 million. In 2011 the company posted revenue of $177 million, but in 2013 the company will see revenue in excess of $500 million. This is insane revenue growth and will be a major catalyst that should catch the eyes of Wall Street in the next year. With nearly $300 million in cash, the company continues to be driven by acquisitions (which will continue in 2013). Therefore, with XPO being an aggressive growth company, and trading at just 0.60 times next year's sales, I expect significant gains, and believe $30 is highly likely.</p><p>I'll be honest, <strong>Alcatel-Lucent (ALU)</strong> has been on my list before, and looking back, has most likely been my most significant failure. Everytime I give bullish outlooks for this company the stock falls further. Therefore, it's safe to say my track record is not too bright in regards to ALU. However, at $1.10 the value being presented in this stock is unprecedented, and now that the company is operating for efficiency and to become more profitable, I think 2013 might finally be its year.</p><p>First, Alcatel-Lucent has rallied more than 12% in the last month following reports that it's in talks with Goldman Sachs about a <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-22/alcatel-lucent-said-in-financing-talks-with-goldman-sachs.html"">potential financing deal</a>. The telecom equipment company is looking to sale certain segments of its business, which stretch across 130 countries. If successful, this sale could give the company more than $500 million in cash, it would unload unprofitable segments, and would be a major catalyst moving into 2013.</p><p>In addition to the elimination of some of its business and the monetization of its near 30,000 patents, the company also will benefit from <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/4700551-at-t-to-invest-14-billion-to-significantly-expand-wireless-and-wireline-broadband-networks-support-future-ip-data-growth-and-new-services"">AT&amp;T's increased spending</a> over the next three years. Therefore, if Alcatel-Lucent will cut down on its less profitable businesses, monetize its patents, and grow its most profitable business, then it could see market leading gains in 2013. Right now, it finally looks as though the company has light at the end of its long tunnel and is moving in the right direction.</p><p><strong>NeoStem (NBS)</strong> as a company is leading the way in an innovating space that is breaking barriers and producing results. In the last year alone, the company has sold its generic pharmacy business in China, announced very strong and <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/neostem-announces-publication-supports-positive-113000028.html"">encouraging data</a> for its lead product AMR-001, showed clinical data for a study on its very promising VSEL Technology, and has seen a significant rise in the revenue of its manufacturing segment with a growing clientele.</p><p>Despite NeoStem's breakthrough year the stock has traded with YTD gains of just 27%. However, NeoStem is a very unique biotechnology business, and presents a rare opportunity to investors with three major catalysts in 2013. The first, as with most biotech companies, is data. The company will be announcing data for its Phase 2 trial. This data should create upside, seeing as how 0% of patients receiving more than 10 million cells saw a deterioration in heart muscle function, compared to 30-40% for those who did not. The potentially $1 billion product is very similar to Baxter's Phase 3 product, which saw incredible results in its Phase 2 study. Therefore, it will be closely monitored and should push the stock higher, both before and after the announcement.</p><p>The final two catalysts go hand-in-hand: The growth of its manufacturing business and the absence of additional financing. In 2012 NeoStem added the Phase 3 company SOTIO as a client, and had two companies enter late stage and large trials in its manufacturing business. All of these companies are currently enrolled in late stage trials and NeoStem has more than doubled its revenue in the process. Therefore, as enrollment continues to progress and studies advance, the company's revenue will rise further in 2013. In a <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/977991-neostem-ceo-dr-smith-talks-pct-potential-and-explains-recent-bullish-developments"">recent interview</a>, the company's CEO Dr. Smith used a $5 billion figure when talking about the potential of this space, which means it's a significant portion of the company's long-term plan.</p><p>Furthermore, the sale of NeoStem's generic pharmacy provides the cash and leverage needed to avoid financing. Some might not consider this to be a catalyst, however the stock is priced in anticipation of financing, so its absence will prove to be highly encouraging for investors. The company has made an effort in 2012 to strengthen its balance sheet, and with the sale of its generic pharmacy, it received over $12 million in cash and eliminated $30 million in debt. When you incorporate this fact, with the $7.9 million in cash reported at the end of September, the company has enough cash and leverage on its balance sheet to move forward without further dilution or public offerings, if desired. Therefore, with additional revenue, lack of financing, advancing clinical studies, and an underperforming stock, I expect NeoStem to appreciate by more than 100% in the next year. This is a company with revenue potential in the multi-billions due to a combination of several revenue producing segments, and next year could likely be the start of a long rally.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b>:</p><p>NeoStem might sound like a strange selection as my stock with the greatest amount of upside, but valuation has to be considered. I view NeoStem as the company with the least amount of downside, the greatest level of unrealized gains, and the most significant catalysts to push it higher. The company has the catalysts present moving into the next year to see record performance.</p><p>Looking at my other selections, Alcatel-Lucent is a strong pick but as a European based company its performance is still tied to the European markets and its ability to execute on its efficiency plan. XPO is my pick for the best stock of the next three years (also my largest holding) but I think 2014 will be the year of XPO. Although it will see market leading top line growth, the company might not see profitability until the end of 2013.</p><p>With a near $2 billion market cap Arena Pharmaceuticals will need all pieces to fall in place, which I do expect, however a $4 billion market cap will be a tough feat, although I still expect great performance. Finally, Seagate has great promise, and great upside, and will trade higher because of its valuation, but in order to appreciate by 100% we will need to see some improvements in PC/laptop sales. Overall, I think each of these companies present very little risk for loss, and a strong likelihood for gains. I believe the risk is worth the reward for each stock, and that this time next year we will look back and realize that these five stocks were among the top performers in the market.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[ARNA]], [[NBS]], [[XPO]], [[ALU]], [[STX]].

(MDVN) and Astellas Pharma Inc. (ALPMY.PK) are stealing headlines for extending the lives of prostate cancer patients with the same success as Provenge.</p><p>When it's all said and done, however, Provenge has still raked in $145.6 million through the first three quarters of 2011, well below the original estimates of up to $500 million, but still a demonstration of significant growth. About $65.8 of that number came last quarter, but the company continues to forecast slowing growth, making DNDN a high risk play.</p><p>As always, though, it's also a potential high reward play, especially from these prices.</p><p>Watch it.</p><p><strong>AMPE:</strong> Ampio Pharmaceuticals (AMPE) has been releasing a <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.blogspot.com/2011/10/ampios-positive-trial-results-solidify.html"">steady dose</a> of positive news over the past few months, and that trend continued last week when the company announced positive results from a study that measured the effectiveness of lead product candidate Ampion in treating patients with nasal inflammation.</p><p>With Ampion potentially being positioned to play a significant role in the future market for anti-inflammatories, these most recent trial results provide <span>additional validation of its effectiveness in that role.</p><p>As previously <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.blogspot.com/2011/10/ampios-rebound-supported-by-milestone.html"">discussed</a>, Ampion, as a molecule already produced by the human body (as albumin), is a considered a biologic with an already-established safety profile, which should make its path to FDA approval quicker than other drugs that are starting from scratch.</p><p>Ampion also <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.blogspot.com/2011/10/ampios-positive-trial-results-solidify.html"">demonstrated efficacy</a> in treating osteoarthritis in the knee, giving Ampio various angles for which to target FDA approval.</p><p>Shares of AMPE have steadied at right around the seven dollar mark on the slew of positive news, but other catalysts are still pending with Optina trials due to conclude early next year for diabetic macular edema and other <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.blogspot.com/2011/09/ampio-pharmaceuticals-on-roll-with-new.html"">licensing deals</a> potentially in the works for the sexual dysfunction drug, Zertane.</p><p><strong>NFLX:</strong> Since announcing and then reversing the questionable decision to split its DVD-by-mail and streaming video services, shares of Netflix (NFLX) have dipped to well below eighty dollars, and then rebounded to over ninety in short order.</p><p>In a volatile ride, share hit the mid-eighties again before rebounding by over three percent on Friday to close the week at $87.75.</p><p>The volatility is likely to continue for Netflix, especially in this market, but a move back to previously-traded levels is possible as investors - and more importantly, customers - forget the silly decisions of the past and start buying back into the service that essentially put Blockbuster out of business.</p><p>Unfortunately for Netflix, the recent slides have allowed competitors to start circling the company's dominance, giving those still short a valid argument that the downturn might not be over.</p><p><strong>CCLR:</strong> Chanticleer Holdings (CCLRD.PK) continues to trade under the radar, but with a well-recognized, all-American brand name in its asset corner, it might not be an unknown for too long. Through an agreement with the late Robert Brooks, who grew the Hooters enterprise from a small chain into an American icon, Mike Pruitt of Chanticleer Holdings was <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.blogspot.com/2011/11/chanticleer-holdings-primed-to-take.html"">able to secure </a>a first right of refusal for the Hooters brand, should it ever go up for sale.</p><p>By gathering some serious investor backing, Mr. Pruitt exercised his first right and landed the coveted Hooters name.</p><p>Chanticleer has since opened numerous Hooters locations <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.blogspot.com/2011/11/chanticleer-holdings-primed-to-take.html"">in high-growth areas</a> such as South Africa and Australia, and is following in the footsteps of other highly successful American chains that have succeeded overseas, such as McDonald's (MCD), Yum brands (YUM), and TGIFriday's.</p><p>With continued growth in existing locations planned, and a possible expansion into other high-growth markets, it's worth keeping an eye on CCLR.</p><p><strong>TTNP:</strong> Attention is back on Titan Pharmaceuticals (TTNP.OB) after a <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.blogspot.com/2011/10/titans-fda-boost-back-to-2.html"">positive meeting</a> with the FDA last month regarding the approval path for its opioid addiction treatment Probuphine, but after an initial spike following the news, TTNP <span>shares have settled again below the $1.50 mark in anticipation of further clarification of a Probuphine timeline.</p><p>Many expect Titan to partner the product, and more insight into that scenario may be given during Thursday's conference call.</p><p>Titan, which also receives an 8% royalty on sales of Vanda's (VNDA) and Novartis' (NVS) schizophrenia drug, Fanap, is also developing Probuphine for the treatment of chronic pain.</p><p>Keep an eye on Titan this week. Shares have traded with volatility of late, along with the rest of the market, but this week's conference call could provide the short term catalyst that some are looking for.</p><p>Should the company have significant news to announce outside of earnings, however, expect it to be released before the call.</p><p><strong>CELH:</strong> Celsius Holdings (CELH.PK) might be back in business again after announcing third quarter results encouraging enough to believe that the company has the ability to exercise a turnaround.</p><p>Earnings from sales of the functional beverage, Celsius, were $2.5 million, up from about $2 million during the previous quarter and up 47% from the same quarter of the previous year. The increased sales number, however, was not entirely due to new product sales, but as the result of a reduction of discounts and promotions this year as compared to last year's third quarter, according to the company's <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Celsius-Holdings-Reports-iw-2185028002.html?x=0"">earnings release</a>.</p><p>In additional news, the company announced that Steve Haley is out as CEO and Gerry David has been appointed as the new president and CEO. A significant amount of debt due to mature next year has been pushed back to 2014, while it was also noted that Carl DeSantis has increased his beneficial ownership in the company's outstanding common shares from 42% to 52%.</p><p>The marketing plan for 2012 involves social/digital media, Direct Response TV, Electronic Retail TV and promotional sampling, and does not include Mario Lopez, who failed at promoting the brand to success during the previous large-scale campaign.</p><p>Sales have stabilized during 2011, indicating a loyal consumer base on which the company could improve, but it's time again for the company to demonstrate quarter over quarter growth that is not the result of canceled discounts.</p><p>With new life now leading the Celsius charge, it'll be worth seeing if the share price can turn around along with the company.</p><p><strong>ALSO WATCH:</strong></p><p><strong>MNKD:</strong> Mannkind (MNKD) has been attracting increasing attention over the past weeks with a short <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=MNKD+Key+Statistics"">percentage</a> of 30% to go along with an increase of insider <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=MNKD+Insider+Transactions"">purchases</a> over the past few months. Although MNKD has been beaten down pretty significantly since the FDA <a href=""http://vfcsstockhouse.blogspot.com/2011/04/mannkind-denied-again-by-fda.html"">asked for</a> new Afrezza trials, the stock could now be positioned as a short squeeze candidate, should any news materialize that would spur mass covering by the significant short interest.</p><p>The time to accumulate may be passing, as Afrezza's market potential as a needless method of delivering insulin to diabetics could be significant. Afrezza also looks to have taken the lead to market over Generex's (GNBT.OB) insulin spray Oral-lyn, for which the FDA also asked for additional trial data.</p><p>Keep an eye on this one, if it moves, it could move quick.</p><p><strong>LPTN:</strong>  With a big-time partner already landed for its novel and unique technology, it might be time to start keeping an <a href=""http://www.vfcsstockhouse.com/2011.11.06_arch.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+vfcsstockhouse%2FaiWT+%28VFC%27s+Stock+House%29#1321110477916"">eye on</a> Lpath, Inc.

"1761542","2013-10-22 15:58:16","Coke's Future Remains Uncertain, While Pepsi Continues To Thrive","<p>Since <b>The Coca-Cola Company</b> <b>(KO)</b> <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/7847972-the-coca-cola-company-reports-third-quarter-and-year-to-date-2013-results"" target=""_blank"">announced earnings on October 15</a> its stock has traded higher by 1.7%, more than tripling the performance of the Dow Jones. Based on this fact, the market must have liked what it saw. Yet, Coca-Cola gave us absolutely nothing to create optimism. Instead, the company's earnings further proved that new regulations on sugar intake and its heavy reliance on sugar is slowly-but-surely killing the beverage giant. With that said, competitor <b>Pepsico</b> (PEP) is better prepared for what's becoming a paradigm shift.</p><p><b>A Bad Story Brewing</b></p><p>Over the last five years, Coca-Cola has been the quintessential mirror of the Dow Jones, both experiencing a gain of 74%. While this looks good on the surface, Coca-Cola has traded flat over the last year. Meanwhile the Dow has increased by 15%. Then reason lies in fundamentals, as Coca-Cola has performed poorly in its last four reports, and especially in its last two quarters.</p><p>So, what is it that has been so ""bad"" about Coca-Cola's last two quarters? Well, the answer is growth. Coca-Cola is no longer seeing growth; it is a distant memory. The company continues to expand throughout the globe and into emerging markets. Yet YTD, the company's case volume has grown just 2%. Moreover, the company has had to become competitive with pricing; thus net revenues have declined, including 3% in this most recent quarter.</p><p>For a non-cyclical company with nearly $50 billion in annual revenue, Coca-Cola should always grow at the rate of GDP, or at least with the rate of population. Instead it's declining-- and the reason has absolutely nothing to do with taste or competition, but rather a more health conscious globe that is taking a stand against sugar. This paradigm has the world's largest beverage company, and one of the most recognized brands, cautious with its guidance and in trying to predict future performance.</p><p><b>What Are the Sugary Problems?</b></p><p>There are several sugary problems facing Coca-Cola and the entire industry as a whole:</p><ul><li>The federal government is <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/27/us-usa-nutrition-schools-idUSBRE95Q0E520130627?"" target=""_blank"">limiting calories</a> in school vending machines. Consequently, this eliminates most Coca-Cola products, which also removes the company from one of its largest consumer bases (teens).</li><li>Our country's largest city, New York, <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1670112-coca-cola-makes-serious-changes-to-stay-on-top"" target=""_blank"">attempted</a> a large soda ban, and many believe that other large cities will follow suit. This would clearly alter the company's volume.</li><li>Coca-Cola does not have the ecosystem in place nor has it invested in an alternative to sugar. The U.S. is heavily structured to produce sugar/HFCS as a sweetener, but alternative sweetener growth is still in its infancy, with land being precious.</li></ul><p>In addition to these fundamental issues, analysts and economists have begun to identify this growing problem for the beverage giant. Credit Suisse Research Institute published a paper earlier this month entitled ""<a href=""https://doc.research-and-analytics.csfb.com/docView?language=ENG&amp;source=ulg&amp;format=PDF&amp;document_id=1022457401&amp;serialid=atRE31ByPkIjEXa/p3AyptOvIGdxTK833tLZ1E7AwlQ="" target=""_blank"">Sugar: Consumption at a Crossroad</a>"". CNBC then followed the report with their own piece, ""<a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/101112144"" target=""_blank"">Sugar: The food industry's tobacco moment</a><u>""</u>?</p><p>The point made is that sugar is today's tobacco of the late-90s, which is a point I made in my previous article. Furthermore, Credit Suisse concludes that a structural decline in sugar consumption is well on its way due to the identified health risks associated with the sweetener. In addition, it was found that the largest of beverage companies are at a crossroads (including Coca-Cola), a point where they must innovate or face a very uncertain future.</p><p><b>Additional Problems Arise</b></p><p>In addition to problems that have already been addressed, and those widely known to the public, there are also a slew of new developments, and other reasons to be pessimistic.</p><ul><li>Believe it or not, the U.S. is not the number one market for consumption. The U.S. had 401 8oz drinks consumed per capita in 2012, which actually ranked fourth globally. Panama and Chile both rank ahead, but Mexico is the <a href=""http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/10/19/beyond-the-earnings-pepsico-vs-coca-cola.aspx"" target=""_blank"">largest market</a> with 745. This is relevant because of Mexico's <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304410204579143820031860270"" target=""_blank"">imposed tax</a> on sugary drinks - eight U.S. cents per liter - passed last week by Mexico's lower house of Congress.</li><li>Soft drink <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CC4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmoney.msn.com%2Fnow%2Fpost.aspx%3Fpost%3Dd2bfc3cd-35b5-4e44-8434-bc9d442811c1&amp;ei=AvBeUpPGDdWl4AOC-YCgCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEq5n5iQ9e2hh2VptNNZic94tCYlQ&amp;sig2=TQlDIZv-8i6TxCNBuO9_Cg&amp;bvm=bv.54176721,d.dmg"" target=""_blank"">consumption overall</a> is at a 26 year low. Over the last two decades, consumption has been volatile, but in recent years, we have seen a steady decline.</li><li>In regards to Coca-Cola specifically, syrup and concentrates represented 54% of the company's total operating revenue in 2008. In 2012, it represented 38% of operating revenue, clearly a decline. The reason for this decline is both diversity and changes in consumption. Still, 38% is a large chunk, and one has to wonder how this number changes if Coca-Cola implements new ingredients to make its products more healthy.</li><li>Juice has seen a steady <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-10-17/can-coke-and-pepsi-overcome-shrinking-juice-demand?campaign_id=yhoo"" target=""_blank"">decline</a> for the better part of five years. In 2007 U.S. consumption per capita was 39.9 liters of juice, but last year that number declined to 35.5 liters. Much like soda, juice is high in sugar, and has been affected by the new healthy consumer. Moreover, Coca-Cola's sales of Minute Maid have declined 11.5% in this period to $1.3 billion.</li></ul><p><b>What About PepsiCo?</b></p><p>In my opinion, Coca-Cola has a great risk to experience significant revenue and stock depreciation. Coca-Cola simply has no answer, and as legislation tightens the company does not have the innovation present to deal with whatever changes take place. Last year, soda accounted for nearly 70% of the company's total sales, leaving the company very vulnerable to these changes.</p><p>The company is testing a stevia-based product called Coca-Cola Life, imitating regular Coke in Argentina, but no data has yet been released. The company is still far from worldwide penetration with this product and others like it.</p><p><b>Dr. Pepper</b> <b>(DPS)</b> is also at great risk, as <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/7139342-dr-pepper-snapple-group-reports-second-quarter-2013-results"" target=""_blank"">total sales declined</a> 1% in its most recent quarter. Moreover, its Dr. Pepper brand saw a 4% decline in volume, as did the company's other brands. Unfortunately for Dr. Pepper, all of the company's brands are beverages, most of which contain sugar. This fact makes for a tough transition to healthier products and makes the possibility of tighter government policy a real threat to its business.</p><p>On the other hand, PepsiCo is clearly affected by the change in sugar demand, but not to the same degree as Coca-Cola or Dr. Pepper. The reason is because PepsiCo is not only a manufacturer and distributor of beverages, but also of food products.</p><p>While Coca-Cola relies solely on its beverage business, PepsiCo's American beverage business was only <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2013/10/16/snack-foods-keep-pepsico-earnings-flat/?partner=yahootix"" target=""_blank"">33% of total sales</a>. Moreover, PepsiCo has a massive food and snack industry, <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2013/10/16/snack-foods-keep-pepsico-earnings-flat/?partner=yahootix"" target=""_blank"">including</a> 22 different brands that all earn more than $1 billion in annual revenue. The company has several brands in chips; it also sells Aquafina water and Quaker oatmeal. While the company still has Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, and other sugary brands, the company is well protected by its diversity in the space.</p><p>During this last quarter alone, sales of its American foods rose 5% year-over-year to $6.1 billion. As a result, global growth in the food industry offset weakness in the beverage industry, allowing PepsiCo to grow while Coca-Cola's overall revenue declined. Therefore, even with industrial challenges, PepsiCo remains an interesting investment opportunity. Once it solves the problem regarding its beverage business, it will become an even better investment opportunity.</p><p><b>What Must Happen with Soda (My Opinion)?</b></p><p>While PepsiCo's business remains strong, right now we are at a crossroads-- a waiting period - and the state of the entire soda industry is at stake. In my opinion the combination of falling sales and volume, more health conscious consumers, and tighter regulations over sugary drinks will lead to Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper's downfall. While I am not predicting a colossal collapse with either company, or an 80% decline in stock valuation, I think we could easily see a 20%-30% correction if these two companies don't start making significant changes to adapt with a new consumer. Historically, all large companies must adapt (e.g., tobacco industry or IBM), and for those Coca-Cola/Dr. Pepper bulls who think a 20%-30% correction is impossible, then simply think back one year to Apple at $700.00 and you'll better understand that when minor problems are realized by the market, large losses aren't far behind.</p><p>In my opinion, there is only one solution to the problem that carbonated beverage companies face: They must find a replacement for sugar that is equally sweet but all-natural. The only possible product is stevia, which is 200 times sweeter than sugar and is all-natural with zero calories. Furthermore, Coca-Cola's decision to launch Coca-Cola Life earlier this year in Argentina (contains stevia) and PepsiCo's partnership with Whole Earth Sweetener Company to produce a stevia product might be proof that this is the direction that such companies are headed.</p><p>However, replacing sugar with stevia is not an easy process, especially for large global beverage companies with billions in quarterly revenue. First, these companies already have well-established ecosystems of farmers, bottling facilities, and fields that are dedicated to sugar production on a global scale. Hence, it would take at least a year to replace that harvest and grow stevia, and even then there are problems.</p><p><a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1712672-coca-colas-move-to-stevia-dont-rush-but-move-quickly"" target=""_blank"">In a previous article</a> I highlighted <b>S&amp;W Seed Company's</b> <b>(SANW)</b> attempt to grow stevia unsuccessfully. The company is predominantly an alfalfa grower, but saw an opportunity in stevia for the reasons noted in this article, and this move took its share price from $5.00 to $11.00. Naturally the company attempted a harvest on just 114 acres of land and then expanded with 150 acres. However, the company then wiped out all but 10%-20% of its crop. Essentially, this experienced grower did not have the know-how or experience for the endeavor, as stevia is not a sweetener that is produced on a large scale, especially in the U.S. Yet, in order for Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Dr. Pepper, and other food and beverage companies to successfully implement stevia without costing billions, each company needs to grow the sweetener in the U.S.</p><p>Given the failures of S&amp;W, large beverage companies simply can't make an executive decision to replace sugar fields with stevia and then hope for the best. They must acquire new acreage for testing and then slowly roll out stevia and implement it into various regions. Consequently, it is not an overnight solution; it is a process-- one that must be executed correctly or it will do more harm than good.</p><p>In my last article, I highlighted a number of companies that Coca-Cola might seek to either partner with or acquire. These were companies that had everything that large beverage companies would need in order to make a smooth transition. However, I do warn that these are very small companies, as the majority of such companies are private and those that are public have spent time in research and are not what you would call ""momentum stocks"" by any measure. However, changes in the food and beverage industry make these unknowns very interesting as large companies are forced into change.</p><p>One of the companies that I identify as having what Coca-Cola needs is <b>Stevia First</b> <b>(STVF)</b>. Now, there are other privately held companies, but none that investors could easily find or research. There are larger publically traded companies, but all have major weaknesses. In the case of S&amp;W it is an alfalfa grower and clearly not a stevia expert. Then there are others such as Stevia Corp, but its stevia is mostly grown in other countries. PureCircle is the largest grower of stevia but does not own its own land and uses third party farmers in various countries. Lastly, Ingredion might be viable, but is mostly a corn-based company-- unlikely for it to change its entire ecosystem to focus on stevia, a product that may or may not grow on its land.</p><p>Stevia First has large sums of land, a fermentation process to refine superior taste, stevia products in development, and has patents and trademarks on its products. In more depth, let's explain why such things are important to Coca-Cola and other large food and beverage companie</p><ul><li>Stevia First has over 1,000 acres in the agriculturally rich Central Valley of California, which is known for its diverse climate. Like I've already explained, Coca-Cola can't necessarily replace current crops without trial and error. Invariably, land becomes precious-- and in its largest market, Coca-Cola needs local land to avoid high costs and keep margins intact.</li><li>Stevia First can modify the taste of its stevia via patents and trademark technology. Last week the company <a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/e/131016/stvf8-k.html"" target=""_blank"">announced</a> trademark requests that will further allow it to utilize its technology to create a better commercial product. Moreover, the company is <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/stevia-first-corporation-issues-letter-130000143.html"" target=""_blank"">preparing</a> for a commercial launch after months of clinical testing, which is a process that other stevia companies must undergo.</li><li>Stevia is healthy but naturally has a lingering aftertaste. Part of Stevia First's fermentation process is to <a href=""http://www.steviafirst.com/about-us/our-product-focus"" target=""_blank"">produce Reb A</a>, which is a part of stevia that is 200-400 times sweeter than sugar. More importantly, it has the best taste profile without the aftertaste. This process would be crucial to large beverage companies who want to replicate the taste of certain products, but don't want a lingering aftertaste.</li></ul><p>Combined, these points could solve most of Coca-Cola's (and the industry's) problems. Now, with that said, I am in no way suggesting that Coca-Cola will acquire Stevia First. However, I do think a partnership with one of the larger food or beverage companies could be a part of Stevia First's future. But also, I think there are several small private companies who offer much of what makes Stevia First interesting; these companies might also be on the acquisition or partnership block.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>Essentially, investors should not be satisfied until Coca-Cola makes more of an effort outside of Argentina, and acquires or partners with a company that has extensive research and experience in producing stevia. I have covered this topic before, but since my report we have seen another dismal quarterly performance from Coca-Cola along with a thorough research report from Credit Suisse-- and other analysts have started to take notice of this consumer shift. The report from Credit Suisse highlights the problems facing sugar. And recently JPMorgan called the state of the <a href=""http://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/Coca-Cola+%28KO%29+Facing+Headwinds+from+Graphic+Mix%2C+N.A.+Volume+-+JP+Morgan/8742572.html"" target=""_blank"">carbonated industry</a>, ""�the worst performance we have ever seen, with volumes continuing to decline despite a falloff in pricing growth.""</p><p>Combined, it paints a very gloomy picture for the largest of food and beverage companies, which makes the strong performance of PepsiCo that much more impressive. In the end, we must believe that these large companies will innovate and make changes to remain a global power, but that doesn't mean that short-term pain will not exist. If this short-term pain is realized, it might make for a good investment opportunity, but until then, I'd be very wary of investing in either Coca-Cola or Dr. Pepper.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

"1304041","2013-03-27 11:51:05","Biotechnology Super Panel Talks Development, Marketing And The Future","<p>For the last two years, I have attended the BIO-Europe, a three-day conference with 1,200 companies and over 130 presentations. These presentations range from single company presentations, company exhibits, and my favorite, large multi-company panels that discuss several key industry-related topics. This is a place where you can see trends in the healthcare industry both before and after they develop.</p><p>One of the best things about this conference is that it sets companies at the same table that otherwise may not talk, and one of the panels that I sat through was one with leaders in the cell-based immunotherapy industry. These were companies of all sizes and stages of development, and it was very interesting to hear each company's take on the space, and each company's theory on commercialization, development, and then future outlooks for the space. Of course any time a company is presenting at a conference, it is always bullish and is always what the investor wants to hear. However this particular panel created a very intriguing atmosphere, where you could see and feel the differences of opinion based on what makes these companies different and based on which companies were using the most advanced technologies. I will share my experiences and my analysis from this one particular panel of four companies and its moderator.</p><p><strong>A Perfect Choice as a Moderator</strong></p><p>To moderate the panel of cell-based immunotherapy developers was Dr. Robert Preti from PCT, a NeoStem (NBS) company. I found Dr. Preti to be the perfect selection, almost like Bill Gates leading a technology seminar, because his company, NeoStem/PCT, has the deepest connections to the space. NeoStem/PCT is split into two segments; it has a clinical development segment and then has a manufacturing segment that has direct ties to many of the present companies.</p><p>In the clinical segment, NeoStem is developing a Phase 2 product in the cardiovascular space and also a new product line called VSELs. But in the manufacturing segment, PCT manufactures and provides regulatory and commercialization expertise for therapeutic development, specifically in cell development. Therefore, with 14 years of experience, 30,000+ cell therapy procedures, and 100+ clients, NeoStem's PCT may be one of the most knowledgeable and advanced companies in the world in regards to the discussion of this panel.</p><p>Although Dr. Preti's job was simply to mediate the panel between the following representatives from the four companies below, there are major ties to these companies. NeoStem's PCT performed the cell manufacturing and storage functions for Dendreon while Provenge was in clinical trials. Currently, PCT is performing these same tasks for ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, which is yet another promising company in development. And PCT is also working with Kiadis, as it endeavors to bring its therapeutic into the US. Therefore, the ties to PCT is clear for the companies below, and with NeoStem's manufacturing business among the fastest growing in the healthcare sector, it is clear to see why optimism is so apparent during this discussion.</p><p><strong>Creating a Path for those to Come</strong></p><p>To represent <strong>Dendreon Corporation (DNDN)</strong> was Christine Mikail<strong>,</strong> the Executive VP, Corporate Development, General Counsel and Secretary. Mikail shared a very different perspective compared to other speakers, as her perspective was from someone representing the first ever approved cell based immunotherapy. And while the drug, Provenge, has had its bumps along the way, the fact is that the company has successfully commercialized Provenge and has proven that such companies can overcome the regulatory and logistic challenges that exist in the cell-based therapeutic space.</p><p>According to Mikail, the company is now evaluating upside potential and commercialization opportunities in Europe, and is even assessing available partnerships with other therapeutic companies that may benefit from Dendreon' s experience in the regulatory and market path to success. To me, this implied that Dendreon is looking to work with clinical stage companies, and leverage its leadership position to advance other therapeutics from companies who have entered or will enter the market in the next few years.</p><p>Mikail's position is that Dendreon's acquired skills and learning's in science, logistics regulatory, and reimbursement arenas, could all serve as helpful to those coming behind it. Mikail also focused on how this knowledge will contribute to the lowering of COGs and the identification of appropriate reimbursement strategies as it enters into the next phase of its life cycle. While many are skeptical that the company will ever reach its goals of drastically lowering COGs, the company is making great strides, including the closing of its Morris Plains manufacturing facility. We should not ignore the company's place in history, or the path it has created for itself and other companies, which Mikail acknowledged.</p><p><strong>A Healthcare Titan Leads Big Pharma towards Immunotherapy Development</strong></p><p>Big Pharma company, <strong>Novartis (NVS),</strong> and its VP, Business Development and Licensing, Oncology, Anne Altmeyer, provided a very different perspective on this emerging industry. For those of you unaware, Novartis <a href=""http://www.novartis.com/newsroom/media-releases/en/2012/1631944.shtml"">licensed</a> a technology from UPenn last year, along with another product from Minnesota, and has since announced its plan to invest $100 million into the technology. The UPenn technology has been one of the more promising technologies in the space, with patients achieving complete remission in early testing. If such results hold in larger studies, this could become a technology that dislocates the existing treatment paradigm of chemotherapy and radiation, and Altmeyer was here to discuss the development of this product from the perspective of big Pharma.</p><p>I find it interesting to see Novartis' level of excitement to &quot;re-enter&quot; the cell based immunotherapy industry on the basis of only a few patient's data, with plans to build its franchise around cell-based medicine beyond cancer. The approach is much different from Dendreon, as Dendreon discusses a &quot;been there done that&quot; approach in cell-based medicines, Novartis looks at development from the point of resources and its overwhelming presence and deep experience in drug development and within the healthcare industry. Altmeyer feels that by applying its sophistication to a developing industry that Novartis could get ahead of the curve and take science over the top into commercialization and distribution. And is particularly excited about their view that cancer immunotherapy is the ultimate in personalized medicines, a particular focus of the company.</p><p>Altmeyer seemed particularly excited about the potential for cell-based autologous immunotherapies in patient specific therapeutics. At first Novartis appeared like a strange company to invest in this technology from UPenn, but after hearing the company's take on its role in developing the space, I think it's clear that Altmeyer feels as though the distance between cell-based autologous immunotherapies and genomics may not be that far apart, especially when you begin to understand their goal of developing the technology and others to be the ultimate patient specific therapeutic. In other words, Novartis has no problem in the regulatory, research, or clinical aspect of development, but it will still be interesting to see what it creates and how it innovates within this space in the next decade.</p><p><strong>Private yet Promising Company Reflects on Progress &amp; Future Development</strong></p><p>Kiadis Pharma is a private company and was represented by its CEO, Manfred Ruediger. Kiadis is a clinical stage company that focuses on innovating therapies for late stage blood cancer and related disorders, with its latest product in Phase 2. Of those participating in the panel, Ruediger reflected upon the past and looked towards the future as an industry more so than anyone else, and not specifically as a company representative.</p><p>Ruediger views the entry of big Pharma as crucial to propelling the space into a more streamlined market, and likens the space to the biotechnology industry of 30 years ago, which people viewed, wrongly, with doubt. While Kiadis may not be important to the average investor, since it is a private company, I think Ruediger's desire to work with other companies, specifically big Pharma, is a desire shared between all companies within the space. A very sensitive subject appeared to be big Pharma's past decisions to not invest in the space, as many might believe that this is due to commercialization, efficiency, and logistical issues with Dendreon. However, Ruediger and others all believe this reality is shifting to a new paradigm, and that new data and current studies will help to break this barrier of thought, and lead to greater big Pharma participation in the future.</p><p><strong>Small &amp; Promising Company Points to &quot;Science&quot; as Determining Factor of Success</strong></p><p>Lastly, was <strong>ImmunoCellular Therapeutics (IMUC),</strong> and representing IMUC was Peter Ho, the Director of Business Development. ImmunoCellular Therapeutics has quickly become a favorite on Wall Street, and among retail investors, as a company with the most impressive data in the cell-based immunotherapy arena. The company has grown from a microcap OTC stock to a $150 million market cap; there were a lot of people interested in what this company had to say about both development and in educating the public. However, Ho continued to reiterate a very science-based outlook on the space, basically insinuating that the science is what will ultimately prevail, and determine success, implying that it is still too early to tell.</p><p>Ho offered a very interesting perspective regarding his belief that the science has been an underlying factor of big Pharma's lack of interest, but that when it's all said and done, science will drive the cure for diseases that currently have palliative treatment options. It is the belief of ImmunoCellular Therapeutics that this science is also what drives the investment, and will ultimately lead to partnerships with other leaders both in the space and with other big Pharma companies that will seek to develop its pipeline behind the therapeutics that are created from the science. I suppose that since ImmunoCellular Therapeutics has enrolled more than 200 patients in its Phase 2 glioblastoma multiforme study twice as fast as any other company and has drastically improved survival that it can boast freely that its science is currently the best. It will be interesting to see if this level of confidence is a sign of things to come for this small cap stock, a company that is expected to announce data in the coming weeks and months.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>When you listen to a typical presentation or an earnings call, you hear a lot of politically correct comments and answers to questions. But when several companies get together, you get to see how they really assess themselves, the industry, and competition. You start to realize that these companies don't see themselves much different from how we view them, and that there are still many barriers to be crossed. It is obvious that within this particular space, the most important factors for success (in the eyes of the company) is science, resources, and also learning from the past and success of others. And there was clear consensus that the solutions, as Dr. Preti enunciated, are clearly forming along the lines of the challenges that are presented. However, what all expect to occur, is a much more significant level of interest from big Pharma and a much more plentiful space with new companies that focus on these type of therapeutics. In the end, this bodes well for the companies who came to the party early, and begun development while others sat on the sidelines. It also bodes well for the moderator, and his company NeoStem/PCT, a company that will grow as new products go into development and enter the market. Overall, it's a win for all those involved, and according to these companies, we will see more success in the years ahead.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[NBS]], [[NVS]].

"668551","2012-06-19 07:08:16","3 Small Cap Pharmas With Major Second Half 2012 Catalysts","<p>The first half of 2012 for the biotech and small pharma sector lived up to its typical expectations of surprises, volatility, money gained and money lost for investors. ASCO 2012 was exciting with solid data proving hope upheld and hope lost with the corresponding share price reactions to reflect on the futures of the presenting companies. Even investors performing diligent research into biotech data and financials are not guaranteed success in this potentially profitable but often unforgiving sector. Like gambling at Las Vegas or Atlantic City, biotech investors must be careful playing all their money on one game and should learn to avoid greed and take profits when the opportunity presents itself.</p><p>The second half of 2012 will likely also live up to the volatile, high-risk and often unpredictable outcomes that small capitalization biotechs and small pharmaceuticals present to investors. The rewards for wise and lucky choices are great, and the downside can be just as substantial. To minimize risk and yet maintain exposure to this exciting sector, investors are often advised to perform significant research in their choices and offset risk by investing in several companies rather than just a handful. Diversification is a great asset that successful investors have learned to utilize. This diversification can come not only in the number of companies invested in, but also the types of pipelines that the companies are developing and the targeted indications. Following are some low capitalization, small pharmaceutical companies representing a diverse choice of pipelines and indications. Each of these has significant 2H 2012 catalysts that can drive the companies' stock prices up or down depending on how the catalysts unfold.</p><p><strong>Horizon Pharma (HZNP)</strong> leads off the group with the only PDUFA date scheduled for this year in the group. With a $160 million market capitalization, the company is surprising cheap for a small pharmaceutical with an <a href=""http://www.horizonpharma.com/ArticleDetail.asp?tid=166"" target=""_blank"">already-approved drug in Duexis</a> for mild to moderate pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. A combination of ibuprofen and famotidine (an H2-antagonist), the combination proves to cause fewer upper gastrointestinal ulcers than ibuprofen alone. The company also boasts an approval in Europe for the sale of Lodotra for rheumatoid arthritis also bringing into question the company's current low market cap.</p><p>Horizon has a PDUFA date of July 26th for Lodotra in hopes of having its rheumatoid arthritis drug sales brought to the huge market in the U.S. To be marketed under the name Rayos in the U.S., the drug is a slow release version of the steroid, prednisone. With more complete pivotal phase III data <a href=""http://ir.horizon-pharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=670758"" target=""_blank"">presented recently</a>, the drug showed impressive efficacy and a slightly safer profile than even the placebo group. The company's stock has just recently started trading higher in anticipation of the impending PDUFA date, but it could trade much higher in the coming weeks. Although not likely a blockbuster drug for the company, Rayos' approval would represent solid and steady revenue in the coming months as its pipeline continues to grow.</p><p><strong>OncoSec Medical, Inc (ONCS)</strong> had a disappointing first half of the year with its stock experiencing a wild drop from February's $0.75 stock price to current lows below $0.20. The company seemed to be trading solidly in the upper range until a $7.75 million offering catalyzed the dramatic price drop from which is has yet to emerge. A devastating blow for shareholders at that time, the current price may present significant upside for new investors with the company's electroporation technology advancing through trials utilizing chemotherapy or immunotherapy agents to attack cancerous tissues. A novel approach to targeting cancer, the technology utilizes a small electrical current applied to cancerous tissue which dramatically increases the porosity of the cancer cell membranes allowing for a much higher dose of the chemotherapy or immunotherapy agent (OMS ElectroChemotherapy and OMS ElectroImmunotherapy, respectively) to penetrate the cells. The electrical current is then removed which allows the cell membranes to return to their original state, trapping the agent inside the cells for a targeted approach allowing stronger dosages at the tumor site while reducing systemic exposure to the agent.</p><p>A <a href=""http://ir.oncosec.com/2012-06-14-OncoSec-to-Present-at-Upcoming-Investor-and-Scientific-Conferences"" target=""_blank"">recent press release</a> indicated a possible exciting 2H of 2012 ahead with hopes that the company's dwindling stock price could start trading higher with the announced catalysts approaching in June and July. Beginning June 18th, Punit Dhillon, president and CEO of OncoSec, will present a corporate overview of the company in investor conferences on June 18th, June 20th and July 12th. Dr. Adil Daud (principal investigator) and Mr. Dhillon will also take turns presenting data on the company's immunotherapy program and on-going clinicals on June 21-22 and July 10th, respectively, at two scientific conferences. These events may catalyze the stock price to some degree; however, the biggest upcoming catalyst will likely be the phase III data presentation of the company's OMS ElectroChemotherapy trial for head and neck cancer. With promising phase II data behind it, solid phase III data could be a significant catalyst for this $10 million small cap biotech. The phase III data is scheduled to be presented at the 8th International Conference on Head and Neck Cancer in Toronto, Canada on July 22-24. An apparent under-the-radar company, the next month could bring significant volatility as investors begin hedging their bets. With the $7.75 million financing behind them, dilution chances at least for the interim should be minimal. However, this is a very small company and downside risk is also there with no marketed product and financials still appearing to be poor for this fledgling biotech.</p><p><strong>Geron Corporation (GERN)</strong> appears to have a dramatic 2H 2012 ahead of it with its telomerase inhibitor, Imetelstat, having topline data being released for phase II trials in breast cancer and for multiple myeloma. Telomerase appears to be a good target for attacking cancer because most cancers have high levels of telomerase activity according to the <a href=""http://www.geron.com/imetelstat"" target=""_blank"">company s website</a>. Adding to the therapy's potential value in fighting cancer in an adjuvant setting with paclitaxel and/or bevacizumab for breast cancer and with/without lenalidomide for multiple myeloma, the drug is also in phase II trials for non-small cell lung cancer and Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) or Polycythemia Vera (PV). However, promising data in preclincals indicating efficacy in inhibiting cancer stem cells (CSC) growth in a broad range of tumors could turn into a huge catalyst in upcoming years. CSC's are thought to be responsible for the recurrent nature and metastasis of many cancers, and solid efficacy in advanced trials could prove to be a significant event as this indication is further investigated.</p><p>As important as Imetelstat can be for its currently targeted indications, the greater upside in the event of success in both efficacy and safety will be realized if the drug validates itself for any one of these indications. Success in one indication can mean real or perceived success in the many other cancers with elevated telomerase activity. The upside here can be significant, while the corresponding downside is also present as failure in a phase II trial could also mean real or perceived failure of the drug's efficacy/safety in most/all other indications.</p><p>Each of the profiled companies has the potential to have phenomenal or devastating times ahead, as most development phase companies can have. Horizon Pharma already has products being marketed, although earnings don't appear to be living up to expectations. Potential competition for its Duexis product from a generic applied for by <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/HZNP.O/key-developments/article/2510452"" target=""_blank"">Par Pharmaceutical</a> (PRX) could take market away from one of the company's two approved drugs in the coming months, or could at least cost the company money in defending its product in the judicial system. OncoSec is a very small company under solid leadership that has no marketed product and only one advanced trial completed in its ElectroChemotherapy for head and neck cancer. Much relies on the phase III data presented in late July via the application of its electroporation technology. Success here could further validate the technology while failure here, at least for the chemotherapy portion of the OMS platform, could be devastating. However, OncoSec's platform is more robust in that it can rapidly be modified to use one of many immunotherapy or chemotherapy agents of choice in the event one fails. Geron Corporation is also in a similar situation with a great deal of time and money being invested in the Imetelstat platform. As indicated earlier, much is riding on the upcoming phase II data to validate or deny the platform's applicability. The company does have another product in its pipeline in the form of its GRN1005 LRP-directed peptide-drug conjugate for breast cancer brain metastases and NSCLC brain metastases. However, these are in earlier stages of development with a smaller target patient set than Imetelstat.</p><p>The 2nd half of 2012 is now upon investors. The next Human Genome Sciences (HGSI) or Dendreon (DNDN) could be out there in the form of any of the above or other companies with emerging pipelines utilizing novel mechanisms to fight disease. However, for each success there are many failures in the small pharma sector. These many failures are partly what provide the phenomenal upside that can be had in wise or lucky choices among the remaining successful few companies. The risk is great in these small cap companies, and the reward can be just as great. Investors are advised to hedge their bets with solid and extensive research and the level of diversification that best fits their style of investment.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[ONCS]].</p>"
"576421","2012-05-10 02:36:08","Pre-ASCO Interview With ImmunoCellular Therapeutics CEO Dr. Singh","<p>As I peruse the biotech forums and boards trying to ascertain investors' and analysts' opinions on my favorite biotechs, I am amazed with the types of personalities, information and misinformation I come across. I weed through the clutter to find the solid points made along with pertinent questions raised. My research on ImmunoCellular Therapeutics (IMUC.OB) is one such example of a biotech with many questions and observations found in these forums. </p><p>Although much can be found in the company's website, clinical data presentations and press releases, I thought it best for the investment community to hear responses to some of these questions directly from the company itself. I contacted Dr. Manish Singh, president and CEO, and presented some of these questions to him. He was gracious enough to take the time to answer the questions and give us valuable insight. The following is a transcript from the correspondence.</p><p><strong>Brian Nichols</strong></p><p>First off, Dr. Singh thank you for taking the time to speak with me, I know that you have been busy. In fact, you are in Spain if I am correct? If you would, could you please explain the purpose of <a href=""http://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/42498/immunocellular-therapeutics-ceo-to-speak-at-phacilitate-immunotherapy-leaders-forum--42498.html"">your presentation</a> at the Phacilitate Immunotherapy Leaders' Forum?</p><p><strong>Dr. Manish Singh</strong></p><p>This is one of the best immunotherapy conferences with participation from all the biotech as well as pharmaceutical companies in this area. I am chairing the opening session with a talk on 15 years of immunotherapy developments followed by moderating several panels on commercialization issues. These are high powered panels with senior management from the pharmaceutical and biotech world. It is also an opportunity for me to present our developments on ICT-107 as a futuristic vision of immunotherapy.</p><p><strong>Brian Nichols</strong></p><p>As you are probably aware, ImmunoCellular's stock had a significant price drop the other day. My guess is that it had something to do with Dendreon's (DNDN) earnings. For some reason investors like to connect the two companies. Do you believe it is a fair comparison? In what way is ICT-107 similar to and different from Provenge?</p><p><strong>Dr. Manish Singh</strong></p><p>Let's start with Dendreon's early problems - cost of goods sold, marginal efficacy of its lead product and a very competitive environment in prostate cancer with approval of other drugs. I truly believe Dendreon was instrumental in opening the doors for small companies like us to build the next generation of immunotherapy product by building on its success. We have tackled all these issues for the success of ICT-107 if approved for brain tumors. </p><p>First, with regard to cost of goods, our cost per shot of vaccine will be under $1,000 while their cost is 15-20 times higher at this point. Second, our phase I data has demonstrated a survival improvement of about 24 months over the standard of care while Provenge increases survival by only 4 months. Lastly, in glioblastoma the best standard of care drug, Temodar, increases life by only 10 weeks. If the survival benefit holds longer than 6-9 months in late stage trials, I think it is very likely to become standard of care irrespective of the cost.</p><p><strong>Brian Nichols</strong></p><p>ICT-107 targets 6 antigens. Why test the vaccine on so many antigens when most other companies only create a drug that targets a single antigen? Do you feel this gives you an advantage? If so, please explain why the company believes this approach is best in treating a number of indications or why it would work?</p><p><strong>Dr. Manish Singh</strong></p><p>Cancer is a very hetrogenous mixture of cell population, and it is an enemy that is always mutating. By targeting multiple targets at once you can hit these cells from multiple points and reduce its ability to escape this attack. Think of the analogy of stopping traffic in a city. The current drug development paradigm is to block a single avenue or street with a drug. All it does is slows down the traffic, but can't halt the traffic. </p><p>What we are trying to do is to stop all the major avenues simultaneously, so the traffic will come to a halt. The beauty is the universality of this approach as a number of these antigens are shared by different cancers. For example, ICT-140 is going to be tested initially in ovarian cancer, but the same product also targets 4-5 antigens on stomach, liver, breast and several other solid cancers as well.</p><p><strong>Brian Nichols</strong></p><p>Most investors expect the company to continue testing its technologies on even more antigens. Can you say how many you would like to test throughout the trial process and what you expect to accomplish by targeting so many antigens?</p><p><strong>Dr. Manish Singh</strong></p><p>There are essentially two pieces to this puzzle: antigen delivery system, which is dendritic cells in our case, and antigens themselves. The dendritic cells we are using are the most potent DCs in the field as these are third generation product, without going into specific technical details, compared to Provenge which is a first generation product. We have been in-licensing multiple antigens from various academic and research centers such as Johns Hopkins and the University of Pittsburgh to build a larger repertoire of antigens to create a patent portfolio that would allow us to target these antigens on an exclusive basis.</p><p><strong>Brian Nichols</strong></p><p>At this year's ASCO you are scheduled to present. What is it that you will be presenting?</p><p><strong>Dr. Manish Singh</strong></p><p>We plan to have two posters at ASCO this year. Let me hold the content until we announce it in a press release in the next few weeks.</p><p><strong>Brian Nichols</strong></p><p>The five year data is expected to be remarkable, considering the seriousness of this disease. If you would, could you please put into perspective just how dangerous and deadly glioblastoma is as a disease?</p><p><strong>Dr. Manish Singh</strong></p><p>With existing standard of care, only 16% patients with GBM live for 3 years and about 10% live for 4 years. Most importantly, the three year disease free survival rate is only 6% and drops below 5% at four years. Phase I data presented so far has demonstrated a 55% overall survival and 38% disease free survival at three years. I must caution you that this is from a single center study with limited number of patients. The Phase II trial is designed to be a randomized and double blinded trial, which is as close to the gold standard trial as one can design. If the Phase II data is even half as good as Phase I, this would create a potential huge opportunity for partnering.</p><p><strong>Brian Nichols</strong></p><p>There is one question that is on the minds of all investors, and that is the AMEX uplisting. Is it fair to suggest that uplisting would provide a multitude of opportunities that are currently not available?</p><p><strong>Dr. Manish Singh</strong></p><p>A national listing would be a game-changer as it is very difficult currently for mutual funds and brokers to buy shares in IMUC. This could potentially bring a completely new set of investors and give us a lot more credibility for the company.</p><p><strong>Brian Nichols</strong></p><p>What requirements would have to be met before you could uplist? Has IMUC met those requirements?</p><p><strong>Dr. Manish Singh</strong></p><p>An Amex listing has certain quantitative measures which is fairly straightforward such as a stock price over $2.00, 400 shareholders and stock-holder equity over $4.0 million. We do meet all of these requirements currently. In addition, the exchange also performs due diligence on your corporate structure, management and board members and company policies.</p><p><b>Brian Nichols</b></p><p>Can you say if the AMEX or another large exchange is part of IMUC's immediate future? And if not, would you like to comment on this matter by explaining what we can expect in the immediate future?</p><p><strong>Dr. Manish Singh</strong></p><p>It is absolutely part of our strategy to be listed on a national exchange. Unfortunately, I can't provide specific dates.</p><p><strong>Brian Nichols</strong></p><p>For such a small company, to what do you attribute your success?</p><p><b>Dr. Manish Singh</b></p><p>We are really a small company, but we have created a very strong culture of innovation, engagement, enabling people with tools and authority, and energizing them to create a win every time. People underestimate the power of a dedicated small group of people to change things. One of the books I am reading right now is <i>All In</i> by Gostick and Elton. They have written best sellers such as <i>The Carrot Principle</i> and <i>The Orange Revolution</i>, which is a very good summary of the corporate culture that we have built. </p><p>This culture plays a huge role in why we have been able to do so much with so little. When I joined IMUC as the first employee back in 2008, the market cap was only $6 million. Today it is close to $100 million, and to a large extent I attribute it to this fantastic management team that has executed at every step even if it meant working 24/7. These guys are ALL IN!</p><p><b>Brian Nichols</b></p><p>Dr. Singh, I certainly appreciate your time and hope investors feel more educated about ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, its product line and potential as well as its impressive team of overachievers.

"1258281","2013-03-08 01:27:59","Seeking Opportunity: Creating A Plan Of Investment Action","<p>Last Monday during a <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/100523155"">long interview</a> on CNBC, billionaire and Berkshire Hathaway CEO, Warren Buffett, said that stocks are still historically cheap, but not as cheap as they were four years ago. This was his response to a question regarding the best investments right now. Buffett believes, like many, that equities are better and cheaper than government issued bonds, junk bonds, commodities, real estate, etc. Yet, despite this notion, there is still a presence of uncertainty as value is becoming much more difficult to find within the market. </p><p>With that being said, there are a lot of people with feelings of confusion regarding investment and trading, and need a plan of action. People don't know whether to jump in, or wait for a better price, or if they should stay out of the market altogether.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is human nature to lust for gains, or see money being made, and to try and chase those gains in hopes of making money. It is this fact that has some believing that U.S. equity markets could trade higher, as everyday people see, read, and hear about large returns and decide to invest in the market. But in this market, with it being so volatile and unpredictable, there are a lot of people who could get hurt and lose a significant amount of their life savings with this &quot;trend-seeking behavior&quot; Therefore, I am looking at three areas to help you determine your next move. I am looking at the market as a whole, I am looking at recent changes to my own holdings, and then I am looking ahead to the next week for opportunities that might be valuable to your portfolio.</p><p><b>A Look at the Market</b></p><p>It doesn't quite seem right that we aren't feeling the effects of the sequestration. In the past, our markets would pull back or fall significantly ahead of big government decisions, mostly due to a lack of leadership in Washington. This latest failure in Washington means that many billions of spending from the federal budget will be removed and will affect a lot of working class folks. Strangely enough, this did not impact our markets, as we continue to trade at all-time highs.</p><p>While Washington remains a joke and the markets march higher, the Fed continues to implement quantitative easing to keep interest rates at record lows. In a sense, our economy is operating like a recession, yet market sentiment remains high. It doesn't make a lot of sense, and has made finding value a very difficult task, as value investors fight the psychological urge to become momentum investors and capitalize on the uptrends in certain stocks such as Google (GOOG), LinkedIn (LNKD), and workday-stocks that are obviously overvalued compared to peers.</p><p>Aside from turmoil in Washington, the Fed trying to play peacemaker, and the overall measure of economic strength (the market) trading at all-time highs, everything else seems to be ticking along quite well. Sure, we don't know the outcome of the European meetings in Brussels, China's GDP target continues to tick lower to a <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/100520513"">target of 7.50%,</a> and the nation's auto capital is near bankrupt after Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, declared Detroit to be in a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/02/us/michigan-appoints-emergency-manager-for-detroit.html?_r=0"">state of emergency</a>, but as long as stocks tick higher these many issues are put on the backburner.</p><p>When you stop to think about everything, it may seem a little scary to invest in this market, and is yet another reason that you have to be both responsible and very careful before diving head first into the market. In fact it's probably better to have a plan. With that being said, let's look at how I am positioning my portfolio, with my most recent moves, for both safety and gains.</p><p><b>A Look At My Portfolio</b></p><p>A couple weeks ago I finished a <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1206401-diversifying-your-portfolio-the-100-000-growth-strategy"">series</a> where I looked at different sized portfolios and adjusted goals and diversification based on the goals of those investors, based on cyclical and secular investments. Right now there is a lot of new money coming into the market, as everyday people see the markets trading higher and believe that now is the time to buy. However, as I explained above, now is when you have to be careful, and have a plan of action for diversifying your portfolio.</p><p>For the last month I have made a conscious effort to go through and trim many of my cyclical investments from my portfolio. The problem is that even secular stocks such as <b>Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)</b> and <b>Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)</b> have become expensive. Therefore, I have focused much of my attention on buying stocks that will perform consistently, and are cheap, regardless of the market. I have focused much of my investment strategy around biotechnology, stocks that are cheap and are performing well in the market.</p><p>For the first time since January of 2012, I increased my position in <b>Galena Biopharma (GALE).</b> A couple of weeks ago I had a <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1243661-a-comprehensive-look-at-immunotherapy-part-2"">conversation with an immunologist</a> that was very eye-opening, and I now believe more than ever that the company will succeed in its Phase 3 trial, and is among the most undervalued in its industry. Furthermore, the stock has become consistent, and has found a level trading range. Last year it was the most volatile stock in the market; it was not unusual for the stock to trade with 40% swings in either direction in any given month. Yet despite its 30% return in 2013, the stock has stayed between $1.80 and $1.95 for several weeks. Consequently, I decided to buy an additional 2,000 shares at $1.90 and I believe that, regardless of what direction the market trades, GALE will trade higher throughout the year as investors await interim data on its Phase 3 trial without the fear of financing prior to data.</p><p>In addition to increasing my position in Galena, I also increased my position in <b>Eli Lilly (LLY),</b> <b>Gilead Sciences (GILD),</b> and <b>Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT)</b> in the pharmaceutical space. I first bought Eli Lilly back on August 8, 2012 at $42.88 and the investment has returned great gains. And although the stock has returned 42% in the last year, there is better value elsewhere. I remain encouraged by the company's pipeline and its ability to maintain sales despite the patent cliff that has hit the industry. In regards to Gilead, I was late to the party, not buying until December of last year. And although it is expensive, with a P/E ratio of 27.40, it is the best of the large biotech names with fast-growing drugs on the market with a very strong pipeline. Lastly, my decision to increase my stake in SRPT carries a little more risk ahead of the company's meeting with the FDA. However, with a market cap of $775 million, this is a stock that I believe could become the next <b>Pharmacyclics (PCYC)</b> with an Orphan Drug that has sales potential of more than $600 million.</p><p>With Gilead Sciences, Eli Lilly, Sarepta Therapeutics, and Galena Biopharma, I significantly increased my position in biotechnology, a space that I believe will provide both gains and security regardless of market direction. However, the problem is that I only increased my position by buying stock in clinical development and large pharma. These four additions do not satisfy the third leg of biotechnology diversification, which is the aggressive growth portion of a portfolio. Thus, I bought two new stocks: <b>Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ)</b> and <b>Santarus, Inc. (SNTS).</b></p><p><b>Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ</b>) is not necessarily a &quot;new&quot; stock, as I have owned it on-and-off for many years; however, Santarus is a brand new position in a stock that I have let slip under my radar for the last two years. Both companies have marketed products, revenue growth of more than 60%, and are trading with forward P/E ratios of about 11.0. Hence, I believe that both are great companies to satisfy this portion of the portfolio, and fit nicely with my other position in <b>NeoStem (NBS),</b> <b>Questcor Pharmaceuticals (QCOR),</b> and <b>Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (SPPI).</b></p><p>Since January 2012 I have been hedging my portfolio with a large position in healthcare. Prior to February, the healthcare space made up 18% of my portfolio; but after recent changes, healthcare makes up almost 30% of my portfolio-a portfolio that is now 84% in equities compared to 89% in equities before (rest in cash). This strategy, including the addition of healthcare or other industries to create safety, was not discussed in the recent &quot;new age&quot; diversification series. However, this strategy along with other more advanced diversification strategies was discussed in my <a href=""http://nicholstoday.com/taking-charge.php"">new book</a>. While it would be impossible for me to fully explain the purpose and the benefit to this particular strategy in one article, the idea involves using the principles in the previous diversification series combined with those taught in my book to create safety and gains by being an opportunistic investor.</p><p>You may notice that I was previously more invested in cash, yet bought more stock. This implies that I sold out of large positions, which is correct. After noticing that <b>Angie's List (ANGI)</b> was undervalued to its peers with the same level of growth, I bought it back at $11.13. However, I sold it on Thursday for a near 75% gain due to the fact that internet-based companies trade with higher betas and my belief that a significant correction could soon occur in the market. The same can be said for the financial space. Accordingly, I sold my position in <b>JPMorgan (JPM)</b>, a stock that I bought after its London Whale debacle. Furthermore, despite my strong long-term outlook for both Pharmacyclics and <b>EOG Resources (EOG)</b>, I also sold both stocks due to large runs higher and both trading with premiums compared to industry averages. These moves allowed me to more efficiently hedge my portfolio with healthcare-a strategy that I believe will pay off in this market.</p><p><b>A Look at Next Week</b></p><p>My strategy has been clear: Heading into next week my goal is to be prepared for whatever the market may bring after reaching new all-time highs. I have chosen to invest overweight in healthcare; however healthcare is not the only safe place to invest in this market. You can invest in any sector, but the key is to seek individual company value in the market and to become an opportunistic investor in this market in order to succeed. As we look ahead to next week there are a number of stocks that I have on my radar. Here are a few to watch next week:</p><ul type=""disc""><li>Take a long hard look at <b>Guess?, Inc. (GES)</b> on Wednesday as the company reports earnings and is expected to post an EPS of $0.87. First off, this is not a luxury retailer such as Michael Kors, but is along the same lines as <b>The Gap (GPS)</b>, and retailers in this category have performed quite well in this market. This stock is cheap with a P/E ratio of 12.39 and it pays a nice yield of 3.0%. So with <a href=""http://www.census.gov/retail/"">December retail sales</a> being strong, North America being a growing segment of its business, and only 30% of its sales, and the company seeing improvements in e-commerce, GES is a stock to watch next week.</li><li><b>Walker &amp; Dunlap (WD)</b> is a commercial lending company that announced earnings on Wednesday and traded lower by more than 6.0% on very <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/5844831-walker-dunlop-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2012-results"">strong earnings</a>. Sometimes these reactions occur after earnings, and it almost always produces great value. This is a $650 million company that is more than doubling in size YOY and has a servicing portfolio of more than $35 billion that will return consistent growth over the next five years. As a result, there is a lot of upside for this stock that is trading at just 13.31 times earnings. I would watch it closely for a reverse next week.</li><li><b>Celldex Therapeutics (CLDX)</b> opened on Thursday with a loss of more than 10%, this occurring after a 45% one-month gain. The company has two late-stage products in development, and will more than likely see FDA approvals for one, if not both, of these products. The loss came after the company reported a wider than expected loss for Q4 due to increased trial costs. However, the company has <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/5865211-celldex-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2012-financial-results"">liquidity</a> of $189 million, which makes its $16.8 million loss less meaningful. With a market cap of $620 million and two late-stage products, I view Celldex as a low(er) risk investment in the clinical biotechnology space. I'd watch the stock next week following this session of profit taking and wouldn't be surprised if this stock recovers in a few days' time.</li><li><b>Mellanox Technologies (MLNX)</b> traded higher by more than 6% on Thursday and reached the top of its trend around $54. The stock has been unable to break through this level since its earnings collapse and Q4 warning. However, the company announced new customers for its InfiniBand and announced a <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/radware-mellanox-technologies-combine-technology-103000537.html"">new partnership</a> with Radware, which then created the gains. With that in mind, watch this stock next week; it could break out regardless of market direction if this news changes sentiment.</li><li>After an unexplained fall, shares of <b>NeoStem</b> traded higher by 11% on Thursday after the company <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/mp#nbs"">announced</a> that its PreSERVE AMI Phase 2 trial for AMR-001 will progress further following a safety review. This is a stock that has a long history of trading in large swings, both lower and higher. Once the trend is broken, either way, it usually sees a fairly significant reversal. Therefore, with large gains on Thursday, watch this stock next week to trade higher regardless of market direction.</li><li>Shares of <b>The Boeing Company (BA)</b> have broken out to trade higher over the last couple of weeks. This uptrend began as the company presented plans to redesign the batteries for its 787 after a slew of problems grounded the planes. Now, after a 3% gain on Thursday, and a stock at new 52-week highs, it will be interesting to see if the stock continues to break out into a new range. The stock is currently trading with a forward P/E ratio of 11.25 and a price/sales ratio of 0.73, both of which are below the S&amp;P 500. I'd watch the stock closely and expect it to outperform the market next week.</li><li>Shares of communications equipment company, <b>Alcatel-Lucent (ALU)</b>, rallied almost 4% on Thursday, giving it a two-day rally of more than 7%. This is a stock that had performed exceptionally well in the first month of 2013, but then pulled back. Now, the stock appears to have found a bottom and is back on the uptrend. With a restructure in full swing, new leadership, new contracts, and with it being one of the most <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1255281-alcatel-lucent-and-netflix-2-technology-stocks-received-the-most-upgrades-in-past-3-months"">upgraded stocks</a> in the technology sector, I'd watch it closely next week to continue its uptrend, possibly retesting 2013 highs around $1.75.</li></ul><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>The markets are trading in uncharted territory, which is both exciting, but also scary for the average retail investor. Those invested in the market are making a great deal of money, though with there being so many economic problems, and potential problems that lie ahead, investors must be careful to enter the market with caution, and with a plan of action. This plan of action doesn't have to include biotech, but you do need a good exit strategy and need to seek those stocks that present value compared to the market. </p><p>As a result, I will be writing a weekly piece to help you navigate this crazy market and to find potential value. I will include a look at the valuation of the market, any changes to my own portfolio, and a review of stocks that might be presenting value. You can then take the information and use it as you wish to seek and hopefully capitalize on opportunity.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[ALU]], [[LLY]], [[SRPT]], [[GALE]], [[NBS]], [[QCOR]], [[JAZZ]], [[SNTS]], [[SPPI]], [[GILD]].

"1334161","2013-04-11 05:55:34","BSD Medical News To Create A Spark","<p>On January 31, Celsion Corporation (CLSN) lost more than 80% of its value after its ThermoDox product failed to show statistical significance in a Phase 3 trial. Prior to this news, Celsion had become the stock-of-choice among those companies developing medical devices and new technologies in oncology. In just one year, its market cap grew from $70 million to $300 million as it quickly created excitement for the space. But since its failed study, the level of interest in the space has fallen, and investors are more skeptical that small medical device companies can succeed in large clinical studies. </p><p><span>In this piece I am looking at what might be the best news for a small medical device company since the Celsion disaster, and how this news might impact the rest of the space and the approach of companies in the space moving forward.</p><p>On Monday, BSD Medical Corporation (BSDM) traded higher by over 17%. This happened following news of an <a href=""http://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/BSD+Medical+Announces+Exclusive+Multi-Million+Dollar+Distribution+Agreement+with+Terumo+Europe+NV+for+MicroThermX%c2%ae+Microwave+Cancer+Ablation+System/8237488.html"">exclusive deal</a> with Tokyo's Terumo Europe to provide BSD's MicroThermX ablation system to 100 countries in Europe. The MicroThermX is a device used to delivery microwave energy or focused-radio frequency to the tumor of a patient with the conjunction of radiation therapy. This is a market-ready product that has flown under-the-radar, and on Monday the company announced this partnership, which will open up a potential <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/6154581-bsd-medical-announces-exclusive-multi-million-dollar-distribution-agreement-with-terumo-europe-nv-for-microthermx-microwave-cancer-ablation-system"">$1 billion market</a> for both companies.</p><p>BSD Medical is a company with no meaningful revenue. Over the last 12 months it has reported <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/6081871-bsd-medical-announces-financial-results-for-second-quarter-and-first-six-months-of-fiscal-2013"">revenue</a> of $2.62 million, but does not have an established marketing or manufacturing plan in place to successfully market its products. This is a company with an operating margin of (316.42%) over the last 12 months, posting a net loss of more than $8 million in the year. The fundamental positive is that with $7.73 million in cash, the company could operate without financing, however it chose not.</p><p> Following its partnership announcement, the company announced a <a href=""http://www.4-traders.com/BSD-MEDICAL-CORPORATION-2985559/news/BSD-Medical-Corporation-BSD-Medical-Announces-Registered-Direct-Offering-of-Common-Stock-and-Warra-16676047/"">direct offering</a> at $1.23 per share with two institutional investors. The company will receive net proceeds of $5 million which should provide some flexibility. My guess is that the company had already agreed on this deal prior to Monday's large gains. Yet the timing of the offering is one of the reasons that the company is valued at just $50 million, despite having a billion dollar product. In a way, the company does not have the support from investors, and while this is negative, and although it is difficult, we should turn our attention towards the deal with Terumo and its potential impact.</p><p>The partnership with Terumo is sure to create a great deal of interest for the company, and perhaps the industry. Obviously, a company valued at just $50 million with such large sales potential is very attractive, and hopefully after this latest financing there will be no need to raise money further. The big question had been whether or not the company could gain interest for its MicroThermX line. Now that the company has gained this interest, and could now have a commercial success with limited costs on its hands it is very possible that investors will flock to the space. With that said, here are two additional innovating companies (creating new approaches to cancer treatment) that could benefit from this news in the next few months.</p><p>Delcath Systems (DCTH) is a $150 million company that has lost 45% of its market capitalization over the last year. The company's approach is odd, to say the least. It uses a CHEMOSTAT filtering system to make current treatments for cancer safer to use. In a sense, it &quot;filters&quot; the substance, making it less harmful and less toxic to the body, therefore allowing the body to remain stronger while in treatment. Moreover, the system allows an agent to be targeted to specific organs while also cleaning the agent of harmful toxins. Therefore, it works effectively in two ways and has been <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1154031-is-delcath-the-post-celsion-play-on-liver-cancer"">approved in the EU</a>.</p><p>Currently, its largest and most promising (based on <a href=""http://www.streetinsider.com/FDA/Delcath+Systems+%28DCTH%29+Modifies+the+Label+Indication+on+Chemosaturation+System+NDA/7927550.html"">data</a>) market is in liver cancer, and in September the company will seek <span>FDA approval. Thanks to its EU approval, there are many optimistic. However, also on Monday, the company <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/delcath-says-fda-extends-cancer-143349676.html"">announced</a> that the FDA had extended its review on the cancer system (from June to September), meaning it will be a nail bitter.</p><p>The immediate problem that Delcath Systems could face is related to the expense of its operations. The company has just $23 million in cash and reported a net loss of more than $50 million over the last 12 months. Hence the company has enough cash to operate for half a year, and not near enough to launch its technology after an FDA approval. This reality could put additional pressure on the stock short-term, as investors might now expect financing prior to data, especially now that the FDA has extended the review.</p><p>This is a company with large sales potential, and with it already having an EU approval it will be interesting to see if the company is more aggressive in seeking new partnerships. Furthermore, it will be interesting to see if potential partners are drawn to the company. One of its chief problems has been convincing shareholders that interest exists or that it could find a reputable partner for large scale commercial launch. BSD Medical's partnership provides hope for this promising technology, suggesting that maybe there is a demand and a market for the more innovating approaches to cancer treatment.</p><p>The final company is OncoSec Medical (ONCS.OB), and it is even smaller than BSD Medical. It is a company developing what's called the <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-technologies/"">OncoSec Medical System</a> (OMS), which uses electricity combined with a chemotherapy or immunotherapy agent to basically improve the results. So far, the company has had great results with both <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-technologies/immunopulse/"">ImmunoPulse</a> (immunotherapy) and <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-technologies/neopulse/"">NeoPulse</a> (chemotherapy) in early studies, proving not only a local and distant response, but also an increase in the uptake of an agent several 1,000 fold and decreased side effects associated with the agent.</p><p>Much like BSD Medical and Delcath, OncoSec Medical is a small cap stock with very little cash and investor support. However, the company also has much lower costs, losing just $6 million over the last year. Furthermore, the company has cash of $9 million on its <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=oncs"">balance sheet</a>, giving it about 16 months of operational security. By that time investors will already know if its platform is effective in larger studies, and the company will most likely be significantly different in valuation.</p><p>Currently, the system is being <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/oncosec-medical-announces-2013-milestones-110800035.html"">tested</a> on three different diseases, using ImmunoPulse, and has an EU marketing approval for NeoPulse. The company has been pursuing a partnership in the EU, and its possible that the news from BSD could aid in its search. In regards to ImmunoPulse, the company will be <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/oncosec-medical-announces-2013-milestones-110800035.html"">announcing data on three trials this year</a> along with beginning new studies. There are a lot of investors following this company because of its <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-medical-reports-positive-preliminary-efficacy-results-from-phase-ii-study-of-immunopulse-in-metastatic-melanoma-patients"">strong early results</a> and the overall effectiveness of the agent IL-12 (used with ImmunoPulse), and the platform's ability to be used with any agent on possibly any cancer. Therefore, the news from BSD Medical could not only create interest but the success of OncoSec could also add a spark to the industry, if successful at ASCO.</p><p>The most important word in that last sentence is &quot;if&quot; and investors should know that while BSD's new is a win for the space, OncoSec is a speculative stock. The company has the same risks associated with it that are present with other companies of its size that are underfunded. Currently, the company has enough cash to operate throughout the year, but beyond that point is a question. The future for the company lies in data, most of which will be presented in the following six months. It is a big year for this small company, and investors should view it as a high risk and high reward investment.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>With the medical device space in turmoil, these three companies could stand as leaders for the space. Each has a number of catalysts moving forward and has produced good results to date. Sometimes an industry needs a &quot;wakeup&quot; of sorts, and who knows, maybe BSD Medical provided that spark and will attract interest to other innovating companies in the space.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[ONCS.OB]].

"1118281","2013-01-17 14:28:50","'Top Of The Class' Small Pharma Investments For 2013 Part II","<p>In <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1110331-top-of-the-class-small-pharma-investments-for-2013"">part one of this piece</a> I summarized performances for my small pharma investment choices in my January 11th, 2012 piece on &quot;<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/318915-top-of-the-class-biotechs-for-2012"">Top of the Class Biotechs for 2012</a>&quot;. Of the four companies presented about a year ago, two choices pretty much had a disastrous year in 2012 while the other two had an outstanding year. Although my choices were 50-50, money invested evenly among the four picks for the year at the date of publication yielded a net gain of over 100% for the year, returns that I would be more than content with for my 2013 choices. In part one, I delved into <strong>AcelRx Pharmaceuticals (ACRX)</strong>, <strong>Advanced Medical Isotope Corp (ADMD.OB)</strong>, and <strong>Apricus Biosciences (APRI)</strong> and their promise for the year ahead. Following are some additional choices for consideration that will wrap up my choices of class-leading small pharmaceuticals that could lead their respective sectors for 2013. I do not claim that these will necessarily be sector leaders for clinical data, sales or future promise, but rather that these, per my research, could lead their respective sectors in terms of stock gains for the year. Once again, I do not count on phenomenal gains for each of these choices. However, I do believe the net gain for the choices combined with funds evenly distributed among them could again offer solid gains for the year ahead. Most of the following companies should be construed as development-phase entities, so there is an elevated level of risk due to reduced or nonexistent revenue streams and regulatory paths that still must be successfully navigated before their respective clinical candidates can be marketed. Investors should also consider the nature of the small pharmaceutical sector and the implied volatility among its companies with frequent wild share price swings both upward and downward; so these investments may not be for the faint of heart or for those that desire more conservative investments for their portfolios.</p><p><strong>Small Capitalization Revenue Leader in the Stem Cell Sector</strong></p><p>In a sector that has just last year had its first regulatory approval via Osiris Therapeutics' Prochymal for GvHD in Canada in May and then New Zealand in June, much hope is beginning to emerge in stem cell treatment for many diseases and injuries. However, despite its newfound successes, the sector still suffers from a lack of revenue generation with only Osiris even having a marketable product, albeit for a small indication. Due to the revenue generation issues in this largely development-phase sector, one small pharmaceutical rises to the top not by having the most promising therapeutic product in its pipeline but by being the most solid revenue generator of the sector. <strong>NeoStem (NBS)</strong> has a revenue-generating division described as a contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO). The division's name is Progenitor Cell Therapy (PCT), a cell therapy manufacturing and storage facility. PCT provides cell therapy products for both the immunotherapy and stem cell sectors of biotech, and has had a number of new clients added to its customer base in 2012 alone.

To add a speculative nature to an investment in NeoStem, it does have its own stem cell product candidate that is now in phase 2 clinicals in the form of AMR-001, to prevent major adverse cardiac events following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Enrollment completion is expected in early 2013 with interim data sometime in 2H 2013. Although the company's current revenue generation is a growing and increasingly successful reality, a stem cell therapy that could address the large market potential of AMI with over 800,000 cases annually could be a significant and share-price moving event for the company. NeoStem estimates an approximately $1.2 billion target market for AMR-001 in AMI, if clinical trials prove to be successful. Interested investors should perform research into the company, starting with the company's Q3 2012 earnings and then evaluating revenue growth via PCT over the last couple of years. Please note that NeoStem should still be construed as a development-phase company as it has no clinical products marketed, and the company is still operating at a loss, although I expect it to reach profitability soon based on its PCT customer base growth. The revenue is highly significant as it leads the sector and helps to fund company's clinical candidates, thereby <em>reducing</em> the need for investor funding. One of my favorite sectors to invest in and write on, please perform additional research on this company and the rest of the sector to more fully realize the possibilities of not only this dynamic company, but others in various stages of clinicals with multiple indications targeted. The stem cell sector is exciting and full of promise. It continues to validate itself with clinical data and patients' stories of success past, present and likely future. I anticipate more regulatory approvals coming soon and look forward to seeing the first U.S. marketing approval in the near future.</p><p>As a picture is worth a thousand words, so is a chart.

The share price increase has come as a result of promising news on its lead drug candidate, Kevetrin&trade;, a small molecule drug that reactivates tumor suppressor protein p53. Once reactivated (cancer cells have a way of inhibiting p53), p53 induces the expressions of p21 and PUMA (p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis). This reactivation inhibits cancer cell growth and causes tumor cell apoptosis (programmed cell death).</p><p>Volume and share price interest for the company's common shares started to pick up after the company's <a href=""http://cellceutix.com/cellceutix-anti-cancer-drug-kevetrin-completes-dosing-cycle-ready-for-next-cohort/"">December 3rd announcement</a> that the phase 1 Kevetrin&trade; dose escalation trial was progressing well with 84 blood samples from the patients being been sent to a laboratory for pharmacokinetics analysis (an evaluation of how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted from the body). A follow up December 14th announcement from the company confirmed that it was allowed to continue with the next higher dose of Kevetrin&trade;, with dosing to begin on December 16th. Shares continued to climb to the $2.50 resistance mark on December 26-27th after a <a href=""http://cellceutix.com/cellceutix-comments-on-new-york-times-article-heralding-p53-drugs-as-the-new-age-in-cancer-research/"">December 24th response</a> by CEO, Leo Ehrlich, to a December 23rd story in the New York Times titled &quot;Genetic Gamble; New Approaches to Fighting Cancer&quot; and its focus on p53. The New York Times story went on to discuss p53 as the &quot;Guardian Angel Gene&quot; and mentioned work by Merck (MRK), Roche Holding Ltd. (RHHBY.PK) and Sanofi SA (SNY) in &quot;racing to develop their own versions of a drug they hope will restore a mechanism that normally makes badly damaged cells self-destruct and could potentially be used against half of all cancers.&quot; Although obviously disappointed that Cellceutix was not mentioned in the piece, I'm certain Mr. Ehrlich appreciated the exposure for the novel approach to the publication's large readership. Important for interested shareholders going forward was a statement by Mr. Ehrlich in his response noting &quot;I believe that a discerning examination of the article and publicly available information shows that we are not only ahead of these larger companies, but we have a better mechanism which is more likely to function against most cancers. Our research to date shows that Kevetrin&trade; affects both wild and mutant types of p53, a claim that to the best of our understanding, the other companies cannot make.&quot; If clinicals underway confirm this statement, the company's common shares as well as the targeted patient groups (not yet to be determined) could each benefit.</p><p>A December 31st company update gives much information that should be considered as the company heads into 2013 with a now $2.00 share price and $186 million market capitalization. With Kevetrin&trade; in multiple trials, Mr. Ehrlich gave indications of multiple catalysts ahead for the company in 2013 with trial updates and data presentations likely. Company-sponsored clinical trials at Harvard University's Dana-Farber Cancer Center and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, which began in November, are evaluating the drug's safety with pharmacokinetics from the early cohort expected in the short-term. Trials evaluating Kevetrin&trade; for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) and sponsored by &quot;a leading European university&quot; are expected to being in 1H 2013. Data presentations by the company as well as its partners will be significant although these are early stage clinicals. With Merck, Roche, and Sanofi each developing drugs using similar technologies, positive and applicable news from any or each of these companies will also likely have impacts on the company's share price. Additionally, positive Kevetrin&trade; data could also begin turning large pharmaceutical companies' heads, with licensing or buyout potential also becoming evident for the early-stage company before its valuation starts ramping up under its own merit.</p><p><span>Although beyond the scope of this article, investors should also consider the company's lead product candidate,</span> <a href=""http://cellceutix.com/prurisol/"">Plurisol&trade;</a>, <span>with phase 2 trial preparations now underway evaluating the drug's safety/efficacy to treat psoriasis. If the FDA approves the company forgoing early-stage clinicals and allows it to instead start with a phase 2 trial, the company could save much time and money moving forward to its first likely marketable product. Cellceutix is also planning on starting a &quot;proof of concept&quot; trial for Prurisol&trade; in Q1 2013 in the European Union, which could also affect share price in the coming weeks.</span></p><p>A development-phase company, Cellceutix is still largely dependent on shareholder money to fund its operations with the ever-looming fear of dilution in the thoughts of its investors. However, a December 10th announcement by the company of a <a href=""http://cellceutix.com/cellceutix-enters-into-a-10-million-common-stock-purchase-agreement-with-aspire-capital-fund-llc/"">$10 million stock purchase agreement</a> with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC gave terms of some of the best financing agreements I have personally ever seen with a small pharmaceutical company. Aspire would buy $10 million of the company's common shares over the next three years at market price with Cellceutix determining the timing and number of shares to purchase. Terms of the deal indicated no restrictions on the funds, financial covenants, restrictions on future financings, rights of first refusal, participation rights, penalties, or liquidated damages per the agreement. Cellceutix did issue 336,625 common shares to Aspire for consideration of the agreement; however, no warrants were part of the agreement. With cash and equivalents of only $125,000 on September 30th, the financing certainly helps to secure the company and its growing pipeline.</p><p>Cellceutix common shares are now trading at $2.00 at the time of this composition, above the simple moving average (SMA) with technical support seen at $1.75. Although a &quot;watch and wait&quot; approach may often serve investors better for solid entries, the pharmacokinetics results for Kevetrin&trade; are still pending and may send share prices upward once again. Alternately, poor or questionable results may also give interested investors a better entry soon thereafter as the data may or may not indicate efficacy or safety accurately. With the company's recent news serving as the major catalyst for recent price increases, interested investors should also consider the risk of downside if clinicals don't yield positive data. Many indications are potentially going to be evaluated, and failure in one indication does not necessarily failure for another. Also consider, the company's Kevetrin&trade; platform is in early clinicals with marketing potential still years away, but that is typically considered and expected in the small pharma sector and has likely been taken into consideration with the company's $186 million market capitalization.</p><p><strong>Small Pharma Class Leader in the Immunotherapy Approach to Treating Cancer</strong></p><p><strong>Galena Biopharma (GALE)</strong> has had an exciting and catalyst-filled year behind it. Volatility in its common stock tells the story with a 52-week range of $0.40 to $3.54, while trading now at about $1.80. Although its most recent dip can be attributed to a mid-December <a href=""http://investors.galenabiopharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=727526"">$24.25 million offering</a> priced at $1.60, most of the stock's volatility is due to varying opinions on the efficacy of its lead product candidate, NeuVax&trade;, for the adjuvant treatment of Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) breast cancer, now in a large phase 3 clinical trial. The bulls appear to have won the overall battle with the share price up over 280% since January 1st, 2012.</p><p>NeuVax&trade; is described on the company's website as an E75 peptide derived from the HER2 protein that is combined with the commonly used immune adjuvant granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF is used in the first immunotherapy agent used to treat cancer, Dendreon Corporation's Provenge&reg; for the treatment of castrate-resistant prostate cancer. In that setting, GM-CSF is linked to prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), an antigen present in about 95% of prostate cancers to form PAP-GM-CSF. This compound directs T cells to target and attack the PAP-presenting prostate cancer cells. Galena's NeuVax&trade;, with the E75 peptide that is derived from HER2, works on the same type concept by directing CD8+ T cells to target breast cancer cells with the HER2 antigen expression.</p><p>The HER2 targeting is significant as the HER2 expression is found in about 75% of all breast cancers. HER2 expression can be broken down into three immunohistochemistry (IHC) subgroups: IHC +1, IHC +2 and IHC +3 (low, intermediate, and high antigen expressions). Roche-Genentech's (RHHBY) blockbuster breast cancer drug, Herceptin&reg;, had over $5 billion in revenue in 2010 as a result of its target patient group, IHC+3 (high expression HER2) breast cancer patients, making up only 25% of all breast cancer cases. If NeuVax&trade; can successfully navigate the regulatory path, the upside potential could be significant with billions of dollars of potential annual revenue at stake.</p><p>To even consider the potential revenue generated by NeuVax&trade; relative to Herceptin&reg;, we must review the two phase 2 trials, whose primary results were announced by Galena on <a href=""http://investors.galenabiopharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=630974"">December 7, 2011</a>. For the combined HER2 breast cancer patient set, recurrence after resection (surgery) or chemotherapy and then adjuvant treatment with NeuVax&trade; was tracked with a disease-free survival rate of 89.4% in the NeuVax&trade; group versus 79.7% in the control group for a (p=0.098) correlation. This correlation, although in favor of the NeuVax&trade; group, was not statistically significant. However, a subset of 53 patients who had received booster injections of the immunotherapy agent once every six months after the initial treatment regimen had a much better response with a statistically significant disease-free survival rate of 95.9% in the optimally-dosed NeuVax&trade; booster group, versus 79.7% in the control group for a (p=0.016) correlation. This set of patients would be followed for 5 years with final results released on <a href=""http://investors.galenabiopharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=725551"">December 7, 2012</a>. The booster injections are described by the company as combating waning efficacy seen in the patients' immune response via its T cell response. The booster injections enabled the patients' immune responses to remain strong against the HER2-expressed cancer cells, better defending against the cancer recurrence after the standard of care resection or chemotherapy.</p><p>With sound science behind it as validated by Provenge&reg; from Dendreon (DNDN) and solid phase 2 data evident in the patients receiving the booster injections to combat waning immune response, only one bit of information is out there that is keeping the share price at current levels (with a market capitalization of just over $120 million although possibly targeting a multi-billion dollar indication). <a href=""http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/15/8/2895.full"">Phase 1/2 data</a>, the premise on which the ongoing phase 3 trial is designed, was a bit puzzling when comparing the patient response to NeuVax&trade; among the HER2 IHC +1, IHC +2, and IHC +3 patient sets. According to the data, each of the three patient sets had an immune response as a result of the treatment regimen. Perplexingly, the higher expression IHC+3 breast cancer patients appeared to benefit the least from the treatment, an unexpected development that the company has not yet been explained. Low-expression (IH+1 &amp; IH+2) patients had stronger immunologic responses compared with IH+3 patients (P = 0.04), and vaccinated IHC 1+ patients had increased long-term immune response (P = 0.08). Relative to controls, low-expression patients had a mortality reduction (P = 0.08) with the largest decrease in mortality seen in IHC 1+ patients (P = 0.05). The correlation was seen across the board, comparing the lower expression patients versus higher expression patients via ex vivo (external to the body; test tube, for example) and in vivo (in the body) comparisons.</p><p>So, is this a case of &quot;data mining&quot; in which the company is cherry picking patients and using statistics to prop up trial results? I am not convinced of such, and the <a href=""http://investors.galenabiopharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=725551"">5-year phase 2 results</a> for the targeted patient group is convincing. Can I personally offer a suggestion as to why a vaccine that is designed to target HER2-expressed cells seemingly elicits a stronger immune response for low to medium expressions of the antigen than the higher expression cells? I could, but that would really be beyond my area of expertise and could only be construed as speculative. However, the efficacy on the varying levels of HER2 expression (or lack thereof) is a simple fact, and the FDA does not require a therapy's mechanism of activity for regulatory approval for marketing-only efficacy and safety data.</p><p>Regardless of how the company has gotten to this point in the phase 3 PRESENT trial for NeuVax&trade;, 2013 interim data could be the telling sign as to whether the bulls or bears have been correct about its chances for a successful phase 3 trial and subsequent regulatory decision. The trial does seem designed for success with booster doses of the vaccine given every 6 months after the original treatment regimen and with the more positively responding patient subset of IH+1 and IH+2 HER2 expressions. The cancer immunotherapy approach is still somewhat in its infancy with its first FDA approval occurring less than 3 years ago with Provenge&reg; leading the way. There are likely many mechanisms we do not yet fully understand with regard to the treatments. Although the clinical and ex vivo responses to NeuVax&trade; do not seem to give results as expected with regard to the different HER2 expression levels, I am not overly concerned as a member of the scientific community in which end results are certainly not always what they are expected to be based on conventional wisdom. At this point in its development, all that is left is data to prove-or disprove-success in the company's targeted patient group.</p><p>Now trading at $1.80, Galena's common shares are trading at short-term support. Although I cannot discern cash burn rates until perhaps Q1 or Q2 2013 financials are released, the $24.25 million stock offering in early December and recently disclosed <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=GALE"">cash balance</a> of $15.5 million give the company approximately $40 million; that should provide for funding through 2013 and beyond. If interim data are promising, the downside with regard to additional possible financing, regardless of when it occurs, would be minimal as the targeted market group is substantial for this $122 million market capitalization company. The next in line for Galena's pipeline is an FBP vaccine, E39, under development currently in a phase 1/2 trial for two gynecological cancers: ovarian and endometrial adenocarcinomas. Interested investors are advised to perform their own risk assessments and determine if the upside potential outweighs the downside risks in this promising candidate. There will be many questions answered this year once interim data comes to light. Investors will learn quickly thereafter if the choices they made were the correct ones.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[NBS]].

"918031","2012-10-11 07:29:17","3 Companies That Could Soar On Massive Stevia Market Opportunities","<p>Obesity is becoming such a <a href=""http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/obesity/en/"">major problem</a> in many parts of the world that health care experts have suggested that it should be tackled with war-like intent, much like battling an epidemic. The problem arises out of the combination of unhealthy eating habits and the lack of exercise. Sugar and high fructose corn syrup can be found in everything from beverages to seemingly &quot;harmless&quot; food items and have become a permanent part of people's diets. The average American consumes <a href=""http://www.sharecare.com/question/sugar-consume-every-year"">150 pounds</a> of sugar every year, and there is obviously a large market for healthier natural replacement sweeteners.</p><p>Extracts from the stevia plant have been used in some countries for centuries as natural sweeteners and have now started to grab attention, especially when there are some safety concerns about the use of artificial sweeteners. Japan's concerns in this respect led to the approval of the <a href=""http://www.diametrix.net/diabeticherbs/stevia-diabetes.html"">use of stevia</a> in the early 1970s, with commercial production commencing in 1971. The U.S. approved the use of a <a href=""http://www.steviaextract.info/reba.html"">stevia extract rebaudioside A</a> (reb A) in 2008, and the European Union followed suit in 2011. Reb A is one of the four major steviol glycosides found in stevia's leaf tissues that produce its sweet taste, and is the sweetest component at hundreds of times sweeter than sugar. It is also considered to have the least bitter aftertaste.</p><p>This compound is available in the U.S. in the form of <a href=""http://truvia.com/news/media-resources/faq/"">Truvia</a>, which comes from a joint partnership between Cargill and <strong>Coca-Cola </strong>(KO), and as <a href=""http://www.wholeearthsweetener.com/News/Press/080723.aspx"">Purevia</a>, through a partnership with <strong>PepsiCo</strong> (PEP) and the Whole Earth Sweetener Company. Pepsi and Coke have already started using stevia-based sweeteners for some of their products. Stevia-based sweeteners have started taking away market share from sucralose (Splenda), aspartame (Equal), and saccharin (Sweet N' Low). The <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203462304577138521022594412.html"">Wall Street Journal</a> says that Truvia is now a major branded sugar substitute, second only to Splenda in sales.</p><p>One small early-stage company, <strong>Stevia First </strong>(STVF.OB), which is headquartered in the Central Valley region of California, is ready to give the existing players a run for their money. Stevia First is not only focused on refined product sales, but also on supplying its customers with an affordable and steady supply of stevia leaves of consistent quality. Because it is a natural product, supplying steady, consistent quality is not going to be easy to achieve; but such an achievement can provide a substantial competitive advantage. The company intends to overcome the need for continuous laboratory testing to fine tune parameters for manufacturing to compensate for inconsistent levels of Reb A. Stevia First intends to operate an integrated agri-bio business model that takes advantage of a talented pool of farmers, agronomists, and agricultural innovators based in the Central Valley region of California. Stevia First also hopes to establish biotech research partnerships with neighboring universities, which could provide access to government funding for research and development of stevia.</p><p>Stevia First has made huge progress in the implementation of its business plan by <a href=""http://www.steviafirst.com/news/news_releases/2012/04/stevia-first-corp.-leases-1000-acres-for-base-of-commercial-stevia-operations-in-californias-central-valley"">leasing 1,000 acres of land</a> (leasing has the advantage of conserving capital). The company is building research and manufacturing facilities on the land. Stevia First is also working on <a href=""http://www.steviafirst.com/about-us/our-story"">multiple methods</a> of stevia production, including farm-based stevia production and fermentation-based stevia production. Both methods are quite complex, and the production and marketing of California-based stevia products on a large commercial scale is not expected for 2 to 3 years. This is also the time frame to develop preparatory stevia plants. The company has <a href=""http://www.steviafirst.com/news/news_releases/2012/08/stevia-first-corp.-licenses-fermentation-based-stevia-intellectual-property-from-vineland-research-and-innovation-centre"">licensed intellectual property rights</a> from Vineland Research and Innovation Centre, and the license includes compositions and methods for preparing steviol glycosides and steviol through fermentation-based processes. There is also a separate consulting contract under which the two companies will work jointly on developing stevia.</p><p>Stevia First's business model is impressive and it has made satisfactory progress in implementing its plan so far. The company is currently trading around $0.54, between a 52-week range of $0.23 and $3.58. If you are looking to gain exposure to the huge market potential of stevia, you should certainly consider an investment in Stevia First. With a market cap of $27.7 million, it is considered a micro cap company and the risks associated with micro caps is considered to be higher. An investor must weigh the greater risk associated with the potential reward before investing in any company.</p><p>Another interesting company that is taking a completely different approach to the sweetener business is <strong>Senomyx </strong>(SNMX). This company is not attempting to replace sugar, high fructose corn syrup, or other sweeteners. Instead, it is building a portfolio of taste modifiers. The company currently has more than 300 patents pending approval. These taste modifiers increase the sensitivity of the consumer's taste to existing sweeteners so that smaller quantities of the sweetener can be used in products. The company is developing diverse modifiers for different sweeteners, and the market potential is considerable. Consumers benefit from the lower caloric consumption due to a reduced intake, while the manufacturer saves on cost for the same reason.</p><p><a href=""http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress2/?p=4454"">S6973 and S6932</a>, which are sucrose modifiers, could potentially be really big for sales or licensing, or even as a basis for acquisition by other companies. The two modifiers allow a <a href=""http://www.perfumerflavorist.com/networking/news/company/165269586.html"">reduction of up to 50%</a> in the quantities of sucrose used in order to have the same perceived level of sweetness as unmodified sucrose. Sucrose is used in many beverages and foods, and there could be huge upside here if food or drink manufacturers begin to use these modifiers in their products. S52617 (S-617) also has <a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/e/120807/snmx10-q.html"">a lot of potential</a> because it has resulted in a very substantial reduction of high fructose corn syrup and sucrose in taste tests with prototypes of various products. Because of the high levels of high fructose corn syrup used in many soft drinks, success with this product could produce huge volumes of business for Senomyx.</p><p>Another flavor modifier, called S2383, also has a valuable application. It improves the potency of sucralose (which is already hundreds of times sweeter than sucrose) and allows for a <a href=""http://nabc.cals.cornell.edu/pubs/WCIBB2008_proc.pdf"">75% reduction</a> in the amount of the expensive sweetener that is normally used. Two other flavor modifiers, S6821 and S7958, are designed as &quot;bitter blockers,&quot; which means that they take away the bitter aftertaste of some sweeteners, such as aspartame. Since stevia has a slightly bitter aftertaste, these bitter blockers can help improve the flavor, which would also give it additional potential in the market. Senomyx has already received international regulatory approvals for many of its flavor modifiers, and regulatory filings are now commencing for the S52617 modifier for sucrose and high fructose corn syrup.</p><p>Senomyx is <a href=""http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot_article.asp?ticker=SNMX%26articlepage=1%26txtsize=l"">collaborating with companies</a> like Ajinomoto, Firmenich International, Nestle, and PepsiCo, and this could make it an attractive acquisition target. The company is already generating revenues (just over $15 million in the first half of 2012), and nearly 80% are earned from its collaboration with PepsiCo and Firmenich International. The company's cash burn rate has been limited to $6 million for the first half of 2012. <a href=""http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/senomyx-announces-corporate-update-and-first-quarter-2012-financial-results-nasdaq-snmx-1652314.htm"">Senomyx ended the first quarter of 2012</a> with $51.3 million in cash and liquid assets. While Senomyx's products have yet to prove themselves in the market, this company is showing a lot of potential. Senomyx is currently trading around $1.95, between a 52-week range of $1.72 and $5.25. If you believe in the approach of modifying existing sweeteners and its market potential, you should consider investing in Senomyx.</p><p>Another company to watch closely in this space is PepsiCo , which has to address health concerns because it has substantial business in foods, snacks, and beverages. PepsiCo has made a move into stevia-based sweeteners by joining hands with Chicago- based Merisant's subsidiary, The Whole Earth Sweetener Company, in developing a stevia-based product called PureVia, which it is using it for some of its products. PepsiCo is focused on providing healthier foods and beverages, and has made a number of moves in this area. The company is <a href=""http://www.pepsico.com/PressRelease/Tostitos-Artisan-Recipes-Introduces-Two-Delicious-New-Flavors06282012.html"">well aware</a> that consumers are becoming much stricter about what they eat and drink. Over the years, PepsiCo has acquired companies like Quaker Oats and Sabra, and has introduced a number of health-conscious products, including healthier Frito-Lay options, whole grain products, and low sodium items along with beverages that have lower sugar content.</p><p>PepsiCo has recently made a major move away from its traditional beverages by <a href=""http://www.pepsico.com/PressRelease/PepsiCo-and-Germanys-Theo-Muller-Group-to-Enter-US-Dairy-Market-With-European-St07092012.html"">setting up a joint-venture</a> with the Theo Muller Group, a large German dairy company, which will be called Quaker Dairy. The joint venture will sell yogurt and dairy products in the U.S., and this is an important strategy in developing a health food portfolio. The U.S soft drink market <a href=""http://www.nobleinsights.com/samples"">has been shrinking</a> over the past several years, but yogurt sales have grown from under $5 billion in 2006 to $6.4 billion in 2011, and could reach almost $10 billion by 2015. This move will allow PepsiCo to go head on with <strong>General Mills</strong> (GIS), the producer of Yoplait, and Dannon, which combined <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/740831-pepsico-taps-a-huge-market"">account for nearly 60%</a> of all yogurt sold in the U.S. Driven by the expected revenues from the joint-venture, Pepsi wants to generate revenues of $30 billion from its health product portfolio, but it will take some time for results from Quaker Dairy to materialize. In the continuation of this strategy, PepsiCo has already <a href=""http://www.pepsico.com/PressRelease/PepsiCo-to-Acquire-66-of-Russias-Wimm-Bill-Dann-Dairy-and-Juice-Company-for-38-B12022010.html"">acquired a 66% stake</a> in Wimm-Bill-Dann Juice Company, based in Russia, for $3.8 billion, and has <a href=""http://www.pepsico.com/PressRelease/PepsiCoAlmarai-Joint-Venture-International-Dairy-and-Juice-Limited-Acquires-Egyp12302009.html"">cemented a partnership</a> with Saudi Arabia's Almarai. Both of these companies are the largest dairy producers in their respective countries.</p><p>PepsiCo has been very proactive in growing its businesses, and this is evident from its operations in two major emerging markets, India and Brazil. PepsiCo has not been afraid to diversify its products and modify them to suit local tastes. Revenues in India grew 30% last year to $2 billion, primarily due to Pepsi's ability to market products that cater to local tastes. Products for the highly price sensitive rural markets had <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2011/12/23/pepsi-stock-primed-for-71-with-brazil-and-india-coming-on-strong/"">appropriate price points</a> such as the snack Lehar Iron Chusti in the state of Andhra Pradesh at a price of Rs 2 (&lt;4&cent;). PepsiCo is now planning a national launch of the snack as well as the introduction of Quaker Oats in affordable snack pack sizes. Brazil is the second largest producer of crackers and cookies in the world, and Pepsi has acquired Mabel, the country's second-biggest cookie maker, in a deal worth $520 million.</p><p>Unlike its giant rival Coca-Cola, whose sales have been relatively flat, PepsiCo has lots of growth potential, and there is a considerable upside to its stock price as a result. The stock has been trading around $71.11 recently, between a 52-week range of $61.50 and $73.66. The dividend yield of around 3% is an added bonus, and I highly recommend this stock to investors.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[PEP]], [[STVF.OB]], [[KO]].

"1757662","2013-10-21 12:33:02","Celgene And NeoStem: 2 Biopharmaceutical Companies Poised For Growth","<p>It wasn't that many years ago that <strong>Celgene (CELG)</strong> was a $38.00 per share stock with a market cap of $17 billion - that was April 18th 2009. Today it sits at its all-time high at $160.58 per share with a market cap of $66 billion. The company has risen greatly by acquiring quality companies and developing novel treatments making it a multinational powerhouse with six successful drugs on the market. According to the company there are about 300 clinical trials at major medical centers using compounds from Celgene for indications including solid tumor cancers, multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic lymphocyte leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), myelofibrosis, small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer. The company owns or licenses over 800 patents or pending patents worldwide, and has a number of <a href=""http://www.celgene.com/research/ProductPipeline.aspx"">indications</a> in regulatory filing, and eight indications in phase 3 trials.</p><p>I use Celgene as an example because it reminds me of a much smaller company that has such great potential that it may well one day rise from its $143 million market cap to a billion-dollar plus company. The company is <strong>NeoStem (NBS)</strong> and it is on the forefront of developing and manufacturing stem cells for various chronic diseases such as heart disease and autoimmune diseases. Now, to make it clear, I am not saying that NeoStem and Celgene are exactly the same and will have the same outcome - but I am pointing out that Celgene rose via quality products and smart acquisitions and it appears that NeoStem has followed this philosophy with smart acquisitions: four subsidiaries all of which are developing or manufacturing quality products for the stem cell market. And what makes this company valuable is that it is at the forefront of stem cell development, a market that is expected to reach $119.15 billion by 2018, according to a new report published in August 2013 by <a href=""http://investorstemcell.com/forum/act-stock-talk-pps-charts-volume-capital-structure-etc/34187.htm""><em>Transparency Market Research</em></a>.</p><p><strong>Both Companies Developing Autoimmune Platforms</strong></p><p>What attracts me to both companies is that each is developing novel treatments for diseases that affect millions of people worldwide - autoimmune diseases. According to a report by <a href=""http://www.prweb.com/releases/autoimmune_disease/therapeutics_drugs/prweb8957282.htm""><em>Global Industry Analysts, Inc.</em></a>, the autoimmune therapeutic disease market is expected to reach $77 billion by 2017. These diseases include the systemic autoimmune diseases therapeutic market - which include rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and lupus - along with the localized autoimmune diseases therapeutic market - which include, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and Type I diabetes - in sum expected to reach $69 billion by 2019. These numbers do not include the <a href=""http://www.pharmalive.com/asthma-market-to-grow-in-sales-and-prevalency"">asthma therapeutic market</a>, estimated to reach a value of $21.6 billion by 2019, and appears to have a common pathophysiologic mechanism as autoimmune conditions.</p><p><strong>Celgene - Oral Autoimuine Drug Apremilast Shows Great Potential</strong></p><p>Celgene's <a href=""http://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Celgene+%28CELG%29+Unit+to+Present+Data+from+Two+Apremilast+Phase+IIIs/8723031.html"">novel drug, apremilast</a>, a small-molecule selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, has the potential to be a billion-dollar blockbuster drug. The company will present results from three phase 3 investigational trials evaluating the treatment of patients with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Behcet's disease at the American College of Rheumatology Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals annual meeting in San Diego, October 25-31. Earlier this year, Celgene filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval of apremilast as a treatment for psoriatic arthritis. The updated data showed that 31.3% of patients had at least a 20% reduction in pain after 16 weeks of treatment. After 52 weeks, 63% of patients experienced a reduction in pain.</p><p>The company expects apremilast to go head to head against <strong>Abbott Laboratories' (ABT)</strong> highly successful drug Humira, an injectable biologic drug for psoriatic arthritis. And while apremilast's earlier June update from a phase 3 trial was not stellar, it did show similar efficacy and safety compared to Humira. But what may give apremilast an advantage is that the drug is taken orally as opposed to Humira, which requires an injection. Humira's <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/simonking/2013/01/28/the-best-selling-drugs-of-all-time-humira-joins-the-elite/"">peak sales</a> are estimated to reach roughly $11.2 billion in 2016, before declining due to oral alternatives, such as Celgene's apremilast or Pfizer's Xeljanz. Celgene sales projections for apremilast for 2017 are between <a href=""http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/02/26/why-investors-should-love-celgenes-apremilast.aspx"">$1.5 billion and $2 billion</a>, which would make it another successful drug alongside its growing breast cancer drug, Abraxane. And while some analysts see those numbers as lofty, they do expect the drug to gain FDA approval.</p><p>Celgene stock has more than doubled year to date, and has a relatively high PE ratio for its sector - 44.97. But Celgene continues to perform, and most <a href=""http://www.thestreet.com/story/12074045/1/trade-ideas-celgene-corporation-celg-is-todays-new-lifetime-high-stock.html"">analysts still see the stock</a> as a <em>buy</em> while none see it as a <em>sell</em>. The company's revenue growth rose 17% over the same quarter the previous year outpacing the industry average of 9%. In September the FDA approved the uses of Abraxane for treatment in patients with late-stage (metastatic) pancreatic cancer. Abraxane <a href=""http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/celgenes-abraxane-approved-first-line-treatment-pancreatic-cancer/2013-09-06"">sales totaled $427</a> million in 2012, and now has the potential to double as estimates for the pancreatic cancer treatment market in the U.S. is expected to grow to $829 million by 2019. And while Celgene stock is at its 52-week high, there is little reason given its late stage pipeline and successful products that the stock should not continue to rise.</p><p>Neostem - Novel Autoimmune Stem Cell Platforms Could Be Worth Billions</p><p>NeoStem, with its four divisions - Progenitor Cell Therapy (PCT), Amorcyte, Athelos and VSEL- has become a diversified stem cell company. PCT boasts its profitable and growing stem cell contract manufacturing and Amorcyte is in phase 2 studies of the stem cell platform, AMR-001, for patients following an acute myocardial infarction. Though both segments have garnered most of the attention, I postulate its lesser-known subsidiary, Athelos, with its Tregs cell platform, to be perhaps the hidden gem of the company. Athelos, which is in a partnership with global medical technology company <strong>Becton Dickinson (BDX)</strong>, is developing a platform based on regulatory T cells (Tregs) to treat diseases of the immune system.</p><p>The body's immune system is designed to fight diseases, but when the immune system malfunctions it can cause autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, asthma and inflammation. Tregs are designed to maintain order in the immune system by enforcing a dominant negative regulation on other immune cells. In simple terms Tregs tell the other T cells what to do and how to react, and when Treg cells malfunction they send the wrong information to the other T cells and the body over reacts and attacks healthy tissues in the body, thus causing autoimmune diseases.</p><p>Most drugs today treat the symptoms of autoimmune diseases but not the underlying issue - Tregs. Athelos's Treg platform is designed to treat the underlying issue, faulty regulatory T cells that are sending the wrong signal to the body, thus causing such aforementioned diseases. The Tregs stem cell platform utilizes modified Treg cells that have been <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18178825"">previously shown</a> to increase T-cell quantities and function. What makes the Treg cell platform unique is that the goal is to go beyond treating the symptoms, but retraining the T cells to actually cure the underlying disease.</p><p>Currently NeoStem's Treg cell platform is undergoing clinical trials for <a href=""http://jdrf.org/about-jdrf/fact-sheets/type-1-diabetes-facts/"">type 1 diabetes</a>, a disease that affects roughly three million Americans. The company is expecting to enter phase 2 trials in 2014 consisting of 90-120 patients, and is expecting completion in 12 months from the beginning of the trial. Athelos is also conducting a phase 1 study for steroid resistant asthma, a disease affecting 60 million people worldwide. NeoStem has secured the rights to a <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/research-and-development/intellectual-property/"">broad patent estate</a> within the Treg field, covering isolation, activation, expansion and methods of treating or preventing certain conditions and/or diseases using Tregs.</p><p>While a drug platform that is able to treat type 1 diabetes and steroid resistant asthma may well be worth a billion dollars, there is more to the Tregs platform, which is why I consider Athelos the hidden gem of the company. If the Treg platform proves successful in treating the underlying issue of type 1 diabetes and steroid resistant asthma, there is no reason why the platform could not be extended to treat the underlying issues that cause other autoimmune diseases such as psoriatic arthritis or MS. And extending the platform to battle other disease appears to be in the company's future plans. NeoStem is already evaluating extending the platform to fight <a href=""http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/"">type 2 diabetes</a>, accounting for roughly 95% of the estimated 347 million diabetics worldwide.</p><p>As stated earlier, NeoStem has a market capitalization of $142 million, which to me is a bargain considering the potential revenue that could be generated if just one of its platforms gains approval. These platforms are developed to treat some of the most common chronic diseases known to man. If one wants to analyze what a late stage platform can do for a development stage company, one need only look at <strong>MannKind (MNKD)</strong>, which has more than doubled as it entered late stage tests of an inhalable insulin powder for controlling type 2 diabetes and now has a market cap of $1.56 billion. NeoStem is developing platforms that could have an effect on millions of people - and that is why I predict that if either Athelos's Treg platform or Amorcyte's AMR-001 platform is successful, NeoStem should become a billion-dollar company.</p><p>NeoStem's stock took a solid hit when the company announced a <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/neostem-announces-pricing-public-offering-233718336.html"">public offering</a> of 5 million shares at $7.00 per share, to raise capital for research on stem cell therapies, but has since rebounded to close on Friday, October 18th, at $7.02 per share. The public offering along with cash already on its balance sheet provides NeoStem with roughly $60 million of working capital - more than enough to last through a year's burn rate - and should squelch any concerns of further stock dilution in the near future.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Celgene has had an incredibly successful run, and with its product pipeline and acquisitions I foresee the company will continue to grow. There are rumors of a bidding war between Celgene and Teva Pharmaceuticals for <strong>Receptos (RCPT)</strong>, a biopharmaceutical company developing novel treatments for autoimmune disease. The rumor is that bids were between $700 - $800 million. If these rumors are true and Celgene acquires Receptos, it would bolster Celgene's autoimmune drug pipeline.</p><p>While NeoStem is a small company, it is developing platforms in one of the fastest growing segments - stem cell therapies. Each platform the company develops has the potential of being billion-dollar products. Another factor that could raise the value of the stock is that there is only 13% instructional ownership - and as the company grows, interest from other institutional investors should propel the stock higher. I believe that NeoStem is undervalued based on what it is developing. As the drug platforms continue through the trial phase, the stock will gain momentum ... and investors who practiced patience will be well rewarded.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[CELG]], [[NBS]].

"734161","2012-07-19 17:02:47","A Big Win For Neostem","<p><div id=""article_non_filtered""><p>NeoStem (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/nbs"" title=""NeoStem, Inc"">NBS</a>) is a growing cell therapy company with much short, mid and long-term potential. It has the knowledge and experience of several companies that are all rolled into one and centered around growth in the cell therapy arena. The company's long-term potential lies in its Amorcyte (clinical) and VSEL technology companies, although its immediate upside is the PCT manufacturing segment-- a division that will also aid in growing its other segments. The PCT division received some very <a title=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/neostems-subsidiary-progenitor-cell-therapy-113000558.html"" href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/neostems-subsidiary-progenitor-cell-therapy-113000558.html"" target=""_blank"">encouraging news</a> on Monday: that it would be receiving yet another late-stage client (SOTIO), for which it would manufacture the cells for its Phase 3 trials.</p><p>For those not familiar with it, the PCT business is an industry leader in contract development and the manufacturing of cell therapy products. Its services include manufacturing, product &amp; process development, tissue processing &amp; storage, distribution, transport, and various areas of support in clinical trials. The company is currently working with a host of high-profile companies, including the likes of Baxter (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/bax"" title=""Baxter International Inc"">BAX</a>). The company has now added SOTIO, similar to Dendreon (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/dndn"" title=""Dendreon Corporation"">DNDN</a>) in terms of its lead candidate, which is an immunotherapy treatment for prostate cancer, like Dendreon's 2010-approved Provenge. To add validity, Dendreon's Provenge was manufactured by PCT during its clinicals.</p><p>According to NeoStem's <a title=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/neostems-subsidiary-progenitor-cell-therapy-113000558.html"" href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/neostems-subsidiary-progenitor-cell-therapy-113000558.html"" target=""_blank"">press release</a>, the Phase 3 trial will enroll 250 patients and will be SOTIO's first in the U.S. SOTIO is using an immunotherapy <a title=""http://www.sotio.com/about-us/the-company"" href=""http://www.sotio.com/about-us/the-company"" target=""_blank"">approach</a> to target antigens in treating advanced stages of prostate cancer. The reason it's a big win for NeoStem is because the PCT business not only receives additional revenue while SOTIO is in clinical studies, but could earn even more revenue in royalties if the company chooses to use NeoStem following a potential marketing approval of its immunotherapy candidate. With preliminary results showing a clear benefit in the company's treatment, and with it being a Phase 3 candidate, it could create sizable royalties for NeoStem in a short period of time.</p><p>NeoStem is <a title=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/542461-neostem-huge-potential-in-the-cell-therapy-sector"" href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/542461-neostem-huge-potential-in-the-cell-therapy-sector"" target=""_blank"">currently</a> returning $8-$10 million per year in its PCT space with the bulk of its clients being preclinical and early phase candidates. SOTIO now joins Baxter as being one of their two clients developing Phase 3 candidates. Both Baxter's CD34+ cell therapy and SOTIO's advanced prostate cancer treating candidate are expected to produce very large sales pending marketing approval. Therefore, it is a big win for NeoStem, in terms of both immediate revenue from a large 250 patient Phase 3 trial, and long-term revenue after the possible approval. Perhaps more importantly, it gives NeoStem even more credentials in a space where it is already the leader.</p><p>The expenses involved in creating and staffing a facility such as NeoStem's have been well documented. It would very expensive and difficult for a company to create a company such as NeoStem's PCT business. The company has more than a decade of experience in manufacturing virtually all cells, has over 65,000 square feet of development and manufacturing space, and has served more than 5,000 patients with 30,000 cell therapy procedures. Therefore, NeoStem's PCT is top-of-the-line, and with the addition of another Phase 3 candidate, it should encourage other late-stage companies to seek the services of NeoStem. Because the cell therapy space, including cell-based therapeutic vaccines and regenerative medicine, is growing at a rapid rate, a company such as NeoStem is well-positioned to benefit and could produce 100's of millions in revenue in the coming years.</p><p>One of the most significant reasons that I expect large growth from the PCT segment over the next few years is also because of word-of-mouth, and I believe this is effective in two ways. Now that NeoStem has Phase 3 clients it will be attractive to other companies with late stage candidates, and since it successfully led Dendreon throughout the trial process and manufactured its cells with success, it gives the company a selling point for companies in need of manufacturing services.</p><p>The other reason I expect the PCT segment to grow is perhaps most significant, and that is perception. Unless we're talking about OncoMed or Verastem (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/vstm"" title=""Verastem"">VSTM</a>), most clinical stage companies have limited amounts of cash and must take all proper measures to ensure success, and cannot afford to make costly mistakes. NeoStem had already successfully manufactured the cells for Provenge, which is somewhat similar to SOTIO. Both use the immunotherapy approach, target antigens, and treat prostate cancer. When companies such as SOTIO are seeking a manufacturing company, they want to know that the company has experienced success at manufacturing similar drugs. Since NeoStem's clientele continues to grow, and it has manufactured virtually every cell therapy product, it allows the company to provide assurance to clinical stage companies that can't afford to waste money or lose shareholder confidence because of a B-manufacturing company's inconsistencies. Instead, a company will want an industry leader such as PCT.</p><p>There is one final point to consider regarding the manufacturing segment: The PCT business is vital to the success of NeoStem's other segments. NeoStem has a solid pipeline of clinical candidates that require services of an advanced cell production team. And because of the PCT space, NeoStem has built a foundation for manufacturing and regulatory expertise. Its research capabilities are unmatched and continue to grow with every new client; because of its large clientele it has direct relationships to allow for the possibility of future collaborations with large companies. It also puts NeoStem in a rare situation, where it gets to see first-hand the success of other therapies, and learn from the success and failures of therapies from a clinical point-of-view. Therefore, its clinical segment becomes more reliable as it knows what works and what does not work, and it has the expertise to know which cells are most efficient at treating various diseases. This knowledge continues to grow with each and every client, and although the potential revenue and prominence that is created from a new Phase 3 company such as SOTIO is great, it is only one small piece in a much larger picture that NeoStem is creating with its complex, yet promising business model.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/nbs"" title=""NeoStem, Inc"">NBS</a>.</p></div>"
"1907601","2013-12-19 11:51:57","Will Galena's Post-Holiday Charm Continue?","<p>2013 is coming to an end, and investors will now take time to reassess their portfolios and find the best opportunities in the New Year.</p><p>Much like consumers seek the best deals for Christmas, investors also seek value on their Christmas lists. Like merchandise, the best deals often change from year-to-year. Yet despite this fact, <b>Galena Biopharma</b> (GALE) has been a top performer for both of the last two years. However, with 2012 and 2013 now a thing of the past, the real issue is whether or not Galena is still offering investors a Christmas value.</p><p><b>A Value Shopper's Paradise</b></p><p>To fully understand whether or not Galena has reached fair value and if more upside exists, investors must understand where it has been and where it hopes to go. Therefore, let's take a look at the last two years and the post-holiday magic that GALE created for value shoppers.</p><p><b>2012: The unknown Becomes Known</b></p><p>2012 was a transformational year for Galena Biopharma: It was this year that Galena went from unknown to one of the year's best performers.</p><p>From Christmas of 2011 to 2012 shares of Galena rallied an incredible 300%. This post-Santa Claus rally begun on January 5 as the company's lead product, NeuVax, forced investors to take a long hard look at its data. On this date, Galena <a href=""http://investors.galenabiopharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=637214"">announced</a> an investigational new drug approval for the Phase 2 trial of NeuVax combined with Herceptin.</p><p>Herceptin is Roche's best-selling breast-cancer vaccine - earning almost $7 billion in the last 12 months - targeting those who express high levels of a protein called HER2. Galena's NeuVax targets those with low to intermediate levels of the same protein, a patient population twice as large with no treatment options. Thus, if Herceptin can earn $7 billion with half the population, then conventional wisdom suggests NeuVax could earn large sales if successful. At the time, Galena was a $40 to $50 million company, making the risk/reward ratio very favorable, especially considering the data that followed.</p><p>Then, <a href=""http://investors.galenabiopharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=641187"">Galena initiated its Phase 3 PRESENT trial</a> with NeuVax on January 20, signaling to investors that NeuVax successfully passed the first two stages of testing and was nearing clinical completion. In June <a href=""http://investors.galenabiopharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=680008"">Galena presented 60-month data</a> from its Phase 2 trial, showing that NeuVax reduced the recurrence in 78.4% of patients who were optimally dosed and received boosters. It was this patient population that would be treated in the Phase 3 study, thus increasing optimism surrounding the vaccine's likelihood of success.</p><p>While the above catalysts highlight the bulk of what drove shares higher in 2012, there were other developments that also created some momentum. The company did <a href=""http://investors.galenabiopharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=692800"">obtain</a> a patent on NeuVax until 2028, thus eliminating what could be a future overhang. Moreover, Galena completed its first two partnerships, one with <b>Teva</b> (TEVA) to <a href=""http://investors.galenabiopharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=724704"">market NeuVax in Israel</a> and another with Leica Biosystems to utilize its technology in <a href=""http://pharmabiz.com/NewsDetails.aspx?aid=72602&amp;sid=2"">screening HER2 -qualifying patients</a>.</p><p>Overall, it was an eventful year for Galena, one that put the company on the map.</p><p><b>2013: Not a One-Trick Pony</b></p><p>After 2012, not many dreamt that 2013 or the following Christmas-to-Christmas period could be as good - or better. However, Galena has soared more than 150% in that period, driven by a number of new catalysts that no one saw coming.</p><p>The big shocker of the year was definitely the <a href=""http://investors.galenabiopharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=748945"">acquisition of Abstral</a>, which is a fentanyl product for breakthrough cancer pain that dissolves under the tongue.</p><p>For the most part, clinical stage biotechs dilute stock to fund operations and progress clinical studies. The only exception is if there's a partnership or if the company in question is one of the newer IPOs of 2013 that have raised 100s of millions before ever producing human data. In the case of Galena, it had a very interesting philosophy, and acted on that philosophy when it acquired Abstral to sell and earn revenues while developing NeuVax. The sales from Abstral might not prevent all future dilution, but its earnings will at least limit dilution - that is if sales are strong.</p><p>When Galena purchased Abstral, there was every reason in the world to be bullish. In 2012, Abstral had sales of $54 million, growth of more than 40%, and Galena had set the bar extremely low with average estimates of just $2 million in 2013. Abstral then officially launched at the start of the fourth quarter, but surprisingly <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/8097492-galena-biopharma-reports-third-quarter-2013-results"">earned</a> $1.2 million in the third quarter before the drug was officially launched. This means that sales are progressing far faster than the company anticipated, and that Galena is on track to crush its $2 million annual goal. This fact alone served as a major catalyst and is the primary reason that Galena has soared more than 100% in the last three months.</p><p>Additionally, financing is no longer a short-term fear, as Galena now has around $65 million on its balance sheet, or enough to fund operations for two years. The company also presented data on an early stage product called FBP, which targets patients at high risk of recurrence for endometrial and ovarian cancers. In a small study, patients treated with FBP had a recurrence rate of 13.3 while the control group saw a 25% recurrence rate.</p><p>This data combined with the acquisition and launch of Abstral suggests that Galena might be more than a one-trick pony.</p><p><b>2014: What Comes Next?</b></p><p>As we reflect on the last two years, and the consistent performance, the biggest question is whether or not Galena is presenting &quot;Christmas value&quot; like in years past.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no way to know for certain the answer to that question. However, what really strikes me as interesting is that news regarding NeuVax was very quiet in 2013. Now, with enrollment being two years in the process, it's very likely that we could see NeuVax-related catalysts, which could move the stock significantly if positive.</p><p>Like I said, we won't have to worry about dilution, and clearly sales of Abstral will move the stock one way or the other. With that said, investors might want to note the stock performance of <b>Insys Therapeutics</b> (INSY). This is a company that markets and sells a fentanyl-based product called <span>Subsys</span>. In 2013, all of its 420% gains have been in relation to the sales of this one product. Hence, Insys supports a $1 billion market cap due to its fentanyl product, meaning if sales of NeuVax are real strong, Galena could be a $1 billion company without any regard for NeuVax or its pipeline. This fact is one potential catalyst to monitor.</p><p>Furthermore, as the Phase 3 trial progresses, it is possible that we see additional partnerships. While partnerships or acquisitions are 100% speculative, Galena is likely gaining some interest or attention due to its stock performance, data and the sales potential of NeuVax.</p><p>With that said, investors will anxiously await interim data on the Phase 3 study along with any other trial updates. These will serve as huge catalysts, as will any updates on Galena's trial in combination with NeuVax and Herceptin. Strangely, due to the excitement surrounding Abstral not many have mentioned or discussed the implications of a successful NeuVax/Herceptin trial, which of course would create significant gains.</p><p><b>Final Thoughts</b></p><p>As with the Teva partnership and the data itself in 2012 or the Abstral acquisition in 2013, there will likely be a catalyst that we don't see coming. Yet based on those catalysts we can predict and expect 2014 might be setting up to be Galena's best and most transformational year to-date.</p><p>Therefore, keep in mind the unprecedented upside that's present if in fact NeuVax works. <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/currents/post/1433661"">Oppenheimer recently initiated coverage of GALE</a> with an &quot;Outperform&quot; rating and a $6.00 price target, saying data is encouraging and that NeuVax has a $5 billion global commercial opportunity.</p><p>With that said, consider valuations and premiums in biotechnology, such as <b>Pharmacyclics</b> (PCYC), another company with a single-drug (expected) blockbuster in oncology. Its lead drug, Imbruvica, has peak sales estimates of $6 billion. Yet because of a partnership with <b>Johnson &amp; Johnson</b> (JNJ), Pharmacyclics can only realize up to $3 billion of that revenue. Moreover, Pharmacyclics is yet to realize one dollar of revenue, but already trades with a price-to-peak sales ratio of 2.6.</p><p>If we use <span>Pharmacyclics'</span> valuation as a guide, then Galena might be fairly valued with a market cap of $13 billion if NeuVax is proven successful - or a price over $120.00. While this might sound absurd, the implications of a successful NeuVax are tremendous. But keep in mind that there are still many bridges to cross. Still, given this upside and the data that's known, Galena still seems like a great risk/reward investment at $4.00, which is reason to be bullish into next year.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[GALE]], [[JNJ]].

"750501","2012-07-26 02:53:06","Significant Investment Potential In The Fast Growing Metastatic Melanoma Market","<p>Melanoma is one of the most common cancers in the U.S. in which the best treatment approach has always been early detection followed by surgical removal. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to detect cancer at its earliest stage, which creates a need for effective treatments for the advanced stages of the disease. In the past, late stage melanoma patients faced high recurrence rates, unbearable side effects, and somewhat ineffective treatments that made late stage melanoma a very dangerous cancer. The disease itself is very hard to treat as it spreads to distant lymph nodes and usually results in several tumors.</p><p>The good news is that biotechnology companies are now racing with great urgency to find effective treatments. We have already seen recent approvals of drugs that are more effective than treatments of old and a slew of drugs or therapies in clinical trials that look poised to benefit from a multi-billion dollar, violent, and fast-growing space.</p><p>For  the treatment of late stage melanoma, there are three primary  treatments that have controlled the market for many years: chemotherapy,  intereukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon ((IFN)). For the most part, physicians have relied upon these treatments for late-stage melanoma in addition to surgery and radiation. With  few options, and a large unmet need, large and small pharmaceuticals  have tried many different options over the years with some  degree of success in the last few years.</p><p>Temozolomide,  now marketed by Merck under the name Temodar, is commonly used to treat  melanoma in an off-label setting.  The only FDA approved chemotherapy  agent for the indication, however, is dicarbazine ((DTIC)) with Bayer  owning the rights to the drug back during the 1975 approval.  With  questionable efficacy and almost intolerable side effects, the  healthcare sector has been waiting for quite some time for a better  option to be available.</p><p><span><span><i><span><span><span> </span></span></span></i></span></span>Interleukin-2 in an early immunological therapy approved for stage IV melanoma in 1998 under the name Proleukin.<span><span><i><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></i></span></span>It  is effective in about 4% of patients, but due to the high dosages  required for efficacy, the safety profile for the therapy is devastating  with the treatment being directly associated with fatalities in 1 in  every 50 patients treated.</p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p>Interferon  alpha-2b in an adjuvant setting was approved by the FDA in 1995 to  treat patients with a high risk of recurrence of melanoma.  The therapy was marketed under the name INTRON((R)) and was marketed by Scherling-Plough  Corporation (now part of Merck).  INTRON((R)) improved patients' disease-free progression by an average of about 9 months.  However, it did not increase overall survival and often had side effects in flu-like symptoms over the course of the treatment.</p><p>Yervoy,  marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and FDA-approved in 2011, is an  immunotherapy treatment that decreases death rates by one-third.  With  a $120,000 price tag for its three-month regimen, the therapy was  touted as the first melanoma treatment to give a meaningful increase in  survival time for melanoma. With  a solid working mechanism as a monoclonal antibody, it binds CTLA-4, a  molecule on T cells that suppresses the immune response.  This  frees up the T cells to fight the cancer cells. The therapy is believed  to have the capabilities of treating a number of different cancers.  Yervoy has seen early success, and although its side effects are milder  than other advanced melanoma treatments, it has not been able to avoid  some of the more severe effects rarely seen in immunotherapy such as  intestinal, and immune-related adverse issues in the body. Obviously  these are not as severe as what you see with the older melanoma  treatments, which is one reason, along with efficiency, that Yervoy has  been successful.</p><p>Zelboraf  is an effective treatment for melanoma's that express the BRAF gene,  comprising about one-half of those with the late-stage disease. Also  approved in 2011, the drug is marketed by Roche's (RHHBY.PK) Genentech  division.  The drug works by inhibiting the out-of-control BRAF gene signaling.  This slows the growth of cancer with this type of mutation.  In  late-stage trials, Zelboraf improved progression free survival to 5.3  months versus the 1.6 months for standard of care chemotherapy. A new approach to fighting melanoma, the treatment is not an immunotherapy agent.  However,  it does show that a targeted approach of focusing on specific genes or  proteins may hold promise for fighting the disease.  As  positive as the efficacy values appear to be, however, the safety  profile for the therapy is surprising for an FDA-approved drug.  The most common side effect for the  treatment is a secondary cancer occurring in about 24% of patients, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.  These lesions may be surgically removed and the treatment regimen may continue.</p><p>For those of you hoping to capitalize on the growth of the space there are a variety of investments that are making progress. Yervoy is a fairly new drug that is seeing strong sales and should continue to grow since it may prove to treat a number of different cancers, therefore exceeding expectations. Then there are others in clinical trials such as OncoVex, which was acquired by Amgen (AMGN). <span><span><p>With  phase 3 results due out at the end of the year, the promising oncolytic  virus is modified to replicate in solid tumors and initiate cell  death.   Additionally, the therapy carries the GM-CSF adjuvant, which is an  immune system stimulant.  The dual mechanism approach has impressive  phase 2 results with about 20% of patients achieving a complete  response.</p><p>Similar to the already approved IL-2, the  effectiveness of the cytokine IL-12 as an adjuvant is being tested with a  new technology called OMS ElectroImmunotherapy by OncoSec Medical  (ONCS.OB).  The technology utilizes an electrical current to increase  the porosity of targeted cancer cells so that the uptake of previously  injected DNA IL-12 plasmid into the cells is much amplified, up to a  1,000-fold increase. Once the agent is inside the cells, the electrical  current (or field) is removed which locks the IL-12 plasmid inside the  cells.  One inside the cells, the DNA IL-12 plasmid instructs the cells  to produce IL-12.  This triggers the patients' immune system to attack  the  cells expressing the IL-12 protein -- the ones treated with the  electroporation device.   Like IL-2, IL-12 is toxic at the levels that  would be required injected into tumor sites.  However, the efficiency of  the uptake into the cells as a result of the electroporation process  requires much less of the cytokine to be utilized which dramatically  increases its safety profile. The CEO of the company recently said that  this technology combined with IL-12 is comparable to or exceeds the  response rate of newer approaches to melanoma, including Bristol-Myers'  (BMY) Yervoy and Genentech's  Zelboraf. The exciting news is that this platform is believed to be  capable of reducing toxicity and enhancing potency in any approved  melanoma treatment due to the nature of its technology -- as a device  used to target specific areas.</p></span></span></p><p>Vical's (VICL) late stage candidate, Allovectin, has excelled in clinical trials. The   drug fits into the new category of drugs with strong clinical data and  improved overall survival of nearly 19 months. The successful  immunotherapy approach utilized by Allovectin is novel in that it  triggers a systemic response.  Allovectin is injected into a  cancer tumor where it helps killer T cells recognize and attack it and  other tumors throughout the patient's body with the same protein  expressions.  Phase 2 data were hopeful with a 12% response rate and a median duration of response of about 13.8 months.  Phase  3 topline data should be available in late 2012 and could be a strong  driver for the company's share price as the catalyst approaches.</p><p>At  this time the very large market of late stage melanoma is being faced  with a transition period in which biotechnology companies are now  creating better and more efficient drugs, vaccines, and combinations  with new technologies. Meanwhile, older drugs are becoming less relevant  as their effectiveness and safety profiles are being  surpassed.  OncoSec's OMS ElectroImmunotherapy platform IL-12 is able to  be used with fewer side effects and with  more efficiency, leaving the space wide open for which treatment may or  may not control the space five years down the road.  In  an era in which cost is becoming more important than it should be for  disease treatment, the OMS ElectroImmunotherapy, along with their  counterpart chemotherapy platform in OMS ElectroChemotherapy, could  present viable treatment options as the dramatically-increased uptake  efficiency of chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents means much less of  these expensive active ingredients would be necessary in order to have  the same level of efficacy in treating some cancers.  </p><p>The  upside potential for ONCS.OB could be impressive as the phase 2 trials  report their results using the OMS ElectroImmunotherapy in late 2012 and  the company's financials should be stable for at least the interim with  a recent $7.75 million offering shoring  up its financials in March.  VICL has an exciting year  ahead of it with its phase 3 data on Allovectin being released in the  latter part of the year along with its other upcoming catalysts  including a likely initiation of a phase 3 trial with partner, Astellas,  for TransVax in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)  recipients.  The  trial design agreement already triggered a $10 million milestone  payment to Vical shoring up its financials as well. Amgen's OncoVex may  very well meet the regulatory requirements as well, but share price  upside there could be muted for this $62 billion Big Pharma.</p><div>Late  stage melanoma is characterized as a disease that has spread or  metastasized.  A successful candidate must be able to treat the spread  of the disease, and whatever other manifestation that the melanoma may  reveal itself as. As a result, these new candidates may have uses that  exceed late stage melanoma.  However, the trick is finding a drug that  can pass all the tests and is effective enough to capture the market.  Melanoma may be a disease that we take for granted.  There is no doubt  that it is one of  the more complex cancers to treat, and once a safe and effective drug  is found, that particular drug will profit from a massive market. For  investment consideration, investors will need to sort through the data  and determine which therapy may own this market, because chances are, it  will be one of the treatments mentioned above.</div><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[ONCS.OB]], [[AMGN]].</p>"
"731511","2012-07-19 05:07:22","New Legislation Speeds Up FDA Approval Process for ImmunoCellular Therapeutics And Other Innovating Therapies","<p>As a long-time biotechnology investor, I have grown accustomed to the politics and the sluggish nature of the FDA, and the vigorous process for a candidate to gain marketing approval. I have held biotechnology stocks in every possible situation, from the first day of a Phase 1 trial, all the way to an FDA approval; I've sometimes felt the defeat of a complete response letter, but also the victory of an approval. I saw value in companies such as Questcor Pharmaceuticals (QCOR), Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ), and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (SPPI), but have also held the likes of several disappointments, while promising drugs fail to reach potential and investors are left wondering what may have been. As a result, I think it is safe to say that I have been there, done that, and seen just about everything in regard to biotechnology.</p><p>I have <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/344521-diversifying-your-portfolio-with-biotechnology-stocks"">always said</a> that investing in biotechnology is unlike any other class of securities in the market. It is almost like real estate vs. buying shares of Apple (AAPL). Well, maybe not that extreme, but when you buy stock in a developmental biotechnology company, the stock will not be driven by top and bottom line sales, but rather speculation, potential, and even headline news that could either increase, decrease, or sometimes have no meaning at all in regard to a drug's chances of approval. As a result, it is a very dangerous space to trade in, but for patient investors it is often very rewarding.</p><p>The ultimate thrill for a developmental biotechnology investor is when a company that you've owned for many years, and with which you have endured all the ups and downs, finally gets its day in the sun, and is awarded that prestigious FDA marketing approval, or receives a patent for an innovative technology. At that point all the volatility pays off, and you can sleep at night with a big smile on your face. But unfortunately the process takes way too long. A company must complete at least three trials, and then sometimes further testing to deem it safe for use.</p><p>In the last three years I have watched as the biotechnology space has created a sense of excitement, unlike any period over the last decade. The reason is the new innovative transcendent technologies that have the capability of effectively fighting some of man's most deadly diseases. But once again, the path is long, and despite the technology being present, a company must still jump through all the necessary hoops, to ensure all its &quot;i's&quot; are dotted and its &quot;t's&quot; are crossed for the strenuous process of the FDA.</p><p>The good news for both new and old biotechnology investors is that for innovative drugs, this long unnecessary process could become a lot shorter, with fewer regulatory hurdles to cross. The reason being is a new piece of legislation, &quot;The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA)&quot;, which is in many ways the first step of a major FDA reform; it will promote jobs, innovation, investments, and hope to patients with a wide range of illnesses such as rare life-threatening cancers. It will give the government new performance metrics to accelerate the approval process for drugs that treat certain life-threatening conditions, which will ultimately benefit the patients, physicians, biotech companies, and also the investors.</p><p>The approved legislation provides a much simpler guideline to provide patients with access to new medical treatments. In order to achieve the accelerated approval, there are a number of criteria that must be met; therefore, not all drugs would qualify for the program. Still, this new legislation opens the door for many drugs that are in the midst of the FDA process to obtain the fast-track status. The legislation also provides for &quot;breakthrough therapy&quot; designation for drugs, applicable to those that treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development (according <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112s3187enr/pdf/BILLS-112s3187enr.pdf"">to page 94 of the Innovation Act</a>)</p><p>For those of you who have followed me for any period of time, you know I believe one of the most promising biotechnology companies in the market is ImmunoCellular Therapeutics (IMUC). ImmunoCellular has experienced an incredible year in 2012: It began the year as an over-the-counter stock, but <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/621651-immunocellular-therapeutics-uplisting-to-nyse-could-immediately-open-many-doors"">recently uplisted</a> to the NYSE; on Thursday the company will be ringing the opening bell, and it has returned a gain of 135% so far in 2012. The reason for the company's momentum is its lead candidate, ICT-107, that treats glioblastoma, which is among the most deadly forms of cancer. Patients with the disease are lucky to live one year, and only 6% live three years with the disease. ICT-107 is an early phase vaccine; therefore, we still have much to learn. But since its development, 37% of the <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/488411-breaking-the-mold-of-oncology-drug-development"">patients treated</a> have no signs of glioblastoma brain cancer after 44-63 months (compared to 6% after three years with standard care alone). In my opinion, this definitely falls under the category of drugs with considerable improvements over existing therapies.</p><p>In order to qualify for the accelerated approval, the drug must be innovative, and ICT-107 fits into a specific category that was mentioned in the legislation of cancer therapies with a targeting approach. Therefore, drugs like ICT-107, in some ways, helped pave the way for this bill to be passed. As a result, how could it not qualify for the accelerated program? Furthermore, the vaccine is the most innovative cancer therapy on the market, with its six antigen targeted <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/403531-dendreon-s-woes-mask-the-exciting-opportunities-in-immunotherapy-companies"">approach</a>, compared to the likes of Dendreon (DNDN) which targets just one antigen with its vaccine Provenge. And since targeting antigens is believed to be the key to a successful vaccine, it appears as though IMUC not only has the best vaccine, but also one that would qualify for this accelerated program.</p><p>Over the weekend I took time to familiarize myself with the Act, and read most of the 140 pages included in the FDASIA. On page 90 it discusses why this act was presented and who would benefit from the passing of this bill. Below shows an abridged portion of the Act that basically shows that targeted cancer treatments were significantly important in the wording of this legislation, which means it should be less problematic for truly effective life-saving treatments to reach patients with life-threatening diseases-- a big win for all Americans.</p><blockquote class=""quote""><p>A new generation of modern, targeted medicines is under development to treat serious and life-threatening diseases. As a result of these remarkable scientific and medical advances, the FDA should be encouraged to implement more broadly effective processes for the expedited development and review of innovative new medicines intended to address unmet medical needs for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, including those for rare diseases or conditions, using a broad range of surrogate or clinical endpoints and modern scientific tools earlier in the drug development cycle when appropriate. This may result in fewer smaller, or shorter clinical trials for the intended patient population or targeted sub-population without compromising or altering the high standards of the FDA for the approval of drugs. ((D)) Patients benefit from expedited access to safe and effective innovative therapies to treat unmet medical needs for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. ((E)) For these reasons, the statutory authority in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this Act governing expedited approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions should be amended in order to enhance the authority of the FDA to consider appropriate without compromising or altering the high standards of the FDA for the approval of drugs.</p></blockquote><p>As an investor, and an advocate for cancer research, I am thoroughly excited about the passing of the FDASIA. In this article I used ICT-107 as an example of a therapy that could qualify for the accelerated approval program, partly because I am certain that it would qualify, and also because it shows the level of innovation that must be present in order to qualify. However, there are a number of companies or candidates that would qualify for this program, some include: NewLink Genetics (NLNK), Threshold Pharmaceuticals (THLD), Celldex (CLDX), and Sunesis Pharmaceuticals (SNSS). But when it's all said and done, we are still talking about the federal government and the FDA. Therefore, we should know that changes will not be made too abruptly. However, this Act is a huge step in the right direction to getting innovative drugs on the market in a timely manner so that more lives can be saved and investors don't have to endure the endless rants of the FDA.<em><br></em></p><p>For the full text of the FDASIA law, <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/FederalFoodDrugandCosmeticActFDCAct/SignificantAmendmentstotheFDCAct/FDASIA/default.htm"">click here.</a> And <a href=""http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120711/OPINION01/207110316/1008/Commentary-FDA-reform-triumph-patients-jobs-Michigan"">here's</a> commentary from Congressman Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, representing Michigan's 6th Congressional District in Washington.

"312396","2011-12-07 12:13:32","Lipid Signaling: The Next Evolutionary Step In Wet AMD Treatment?","<p><strong>What is wet AMD?</strong></p> <p>Age-related macular degeneration ((AMD)) is a leading cause of severe vision loss with worldwide incidence of 30-50 million affected with roughly 8 million in the United States. Associated with aging, it occurs when metabolic waste products in the eye are no longer efficiently removed and accumulate in the macula. This buildup restricts the flow of nutrients and oxygen to the cells of the retina and causes them to slowly die. In dry AMD, light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly deteriorate, gradually blurring central vision. As the disease progresses, central vision can gradually become lost completely in the affected eyes. Dry AMD progression is usually painless and slow, and affected persons may not seek medical attention until the disease is fairly advanced. The condition advances in stages and may ultimately become wet AMD. Wet AMD occurs when abnormal blood vessels beneath the retina leak blood and fluid. It is more aggressive, and if left untreated, can lead to irreparable loss of sight within months. Wet AMD accounts for only 10% of all AMD cases but is responsible for 90% of blindness associated with AMD. It is estimated that approximately 200,000 new cases of wet AMD are diagnosed in the United States annually. In people over 50, the global incidence of wet AMD is approximately 1.5 million, with approximately 600,000 new cases of wet AMD diagnosed annually. With the aging baby boomer population in the United States and average longevity in the world increasing, the number of wet AMD victims will likely continue to trend upward.</p>  <p><strong>The Wet AMD Treatment Target</strong></p> <p>The current focus for treating wet AMD is the abnormal blood vessels (lesions) that form behind the retina. These blood vessels form as a result of the body&rsquo;s angiogenic response to other neighboring vessels clogging or compressing creating flow restrictions. The newly formed vessels in wet AMD are abnormally fragile and often leak blood and fluid. This liquid raises the macula from its usual position at the back of the eye and causes damage rapidly.</p>  <p><strong>Chronology of Treatments</strong></p>  <p><strong>Pre-2004 - Thermal Lasers and Photodynamic Lasers with Visudyne</strong></p> <p>Earlier treatments involved thermal lasers that were aimed at the abnormal vessels effectively stopping the leaking and sealing or destroying the non-leaking vessels before they became an issue. Although an effective treatment for some, the prognosis was often poor because only those with abnormal vessels forming away from the fovea (central part of the macula) were good treatment targets. The procedure was also risky because surrounding tissue may be destroyed or damaged. The <a href=""http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2000/21-119_VISUDYNE_APPROV.PDF"">2000 approval</a> of <b>QLT Incorporated&rsquo;s (QLTI)</b> photodynamic therapy for treating wet AMD was a huge advance relative to the earlier thermal laser treatment. It incorporated the drug Visudyne that was administered intravenously. The drug attached to lipoproteins that selectively carried the drug to the abnormal vessels in the eye in minutes. Focusing a non-thermal laser light into the patient&rsquo;s eyes for 83 seconds activated the drug, which caused it to releases singlet oxygen, a reactive molecule that effectively destroyed the abnormal blood vessels and stopped the leaking. The most reported <a href=""http://www.drugs.com/sfx/visudyne-side-effects.html"">side effects</a> of the treatment, occurring in 10-30% of patients, were injection site reactions and visual disturbances including blurred vision, flashes of light, decreased visual acuity and visual field defects. Although stabilizing vision degradation, this procedure also did nothing to restore lost vision. It was a treatment that needed be repeated on an as-needed basis as the formation of new abnormal vessels continued.</p>  <p><b>2004 &ndash; VEGF Inhibition as Wet AMD Treatment</b></p> <p>In December of 2004, the <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/2004/ucm108385.htm"">FDA approved Macugen</a> ushering in a new era for wet AMD treatment. Macugen was co-developed by <b>Pfizer (PFE) </b>and<b> Eyetech Pharmaceuticals</b> and was the first of a new class of drugs binding and/or inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor ((VEGF))-A. VEGF is a signal protein that is thought to play a critical role in the formation of new blood vessels and their hyperpermeability (leakiness). Macugen was injected directly into the eye every six weeks and was proven effective in trials. <a href=""http://www.drugs.com/sfx/macugen-side-effects.html"">Side effects</a>, though typically minor, occurred in 10-40% of patients. The drug was effective in slowing the progression of the disease but did not repair damage that had already occurred and therefore did little to improve lost vision.</p>  <p><b>2006 &ndash; VEGF Inhibition Improvement as New Standard of Care</b></p> <p>In 2006, the FDA approved <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/2006/ucm108685.htm"">Lucentis</a> for wet AMD. Produced by <b>Genentech</b> [acquired by <b>Roche Holding, Ltd. (RHHBY)</b>], Lucentis was also designed to bind and inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A. Like Macugen, the treatment procedure is unpleasant requiring monthly to bimonthly injections of the drug intravitreally. <a href=""http://www.drugs.com/sfx/lucentis-side-effects.html"">Side effects</a> of the treatment are not as serious with vitreous floaters and intraocular pressure increase being the most common. The treatment is costly with a tag of about $1950 per treatment. With injections roughly 5.5 times annually, this adds up to almost $11K annually. The phase III trials did show superiority over the two laser therapies and Macugen with roughly 1/3 of patients in the phase III trials experiencing vision improvement, not just simple cessation of vision loss.</p>  <p>Approved by the FDA for treating colon and other cancers, Genentech&rsquo;s Avastin has also shows promise for treating wet AMD. With a similar mechanism, Avastin also binds/inhibits VEGF and has shown promise to stop the formation of the abnormal vessels and also improve vision after treatment. However, use of Avastin for this indication is strictly off-label which brings in its own regulatory and insurance issues. For patients having poor or no insurance coverage, the key difference between Avastin and Lucentis is price with Avastin treatments costing less than $150 (conflicting prices in literature on the web) per treatment.</p>  <p><b>2011 &ndash; VEGF Inhibition but With Fewer Injections</b></p> <p>On November 18th of this year, <b>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)</b> announced <a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/regeneron-announces-fda-approval-of-eylea-aflibercept-injection-for-the-treatment-of-wet-age-related-macular-degeneration-134147678.html"">FDA approval</a> of its wet AMD drug EYLEA. Similar to Lucentis and Avastin, Eylea blocks the action of VEGF. However, the drug is administered less frequently with one dose every 4 weeks for the first 12 weeks, followed by a dose every 8 weeks thereafter. The price tag, although cheaper than Lucentis, is still $1850 per treatment and still much greater than Avastin&rsquo;s.</p>  <p><strong>Next? &ndash; Lipid Signaling Inhibition as Much Improved Treatment Regimen</strong></p> <p>Advancing from the two different laser treatment techniques to VEGF inhibition was a huge step for treating wet AMD and raised the bar considerably for any other treatments coming to market. However, there is still much room for improvement. Administration techniques and frequency, vision improvement as opposed to simple vision loss cessation, elimination of the lesions as opposed to stopping their formation, and safety profiles are key areas that need to be addressed. A new class of drugs being tested in trials is showing tremendous promise in these areas. <b>Lpath Incorporated (LPTN.OB)</b> is the class leader in this new class of drugs, lipidomics-based antibody therapeutics, in which lipid signaling is the targeted mechanism. Lipid signaling refers to any physiological signaling event involving a lipid messenger that binds a protein target, such as a receptor, kinase or phosphatase, which in turn mediate the actions of these lipids on specific cellular responses. Lpath&rsquo;s proprietary platform, Immune Y2 technology, has a range of applications on these cellular responses including inflammation, cancers, autoimmune as well as the wet AMD application. They have had a great deal of success generating and advancing therapeutic antibodies against specific bioactive lipids. These antibodies &ldquo;sponge up&rdquo; the targeted lipids and bind the receptor sites, effectively stopping the specific pathway signal.</p>  <p><strong>Most Advanced Lipid Signaling Candidate for Wet AMD - Lpath&rsquo;s iSONEP</strong></p> <p>The lead product in Lpath&rsquo;s pipeline is iSONEP, a monoclonal antibody targeting Sphingosine 1 Phosphate (S1P). S1P is a bioactive lipid that is a key component of the sphingolipid signaling cascade. In the wet AMD application, S1P has many actions that promote inflammation and dysregulated angiogenesis. It additionally supports the survival of multiple cell types including fibroblasts, endothelial and inflammatory cells that participate in the dysfunctional processes of wet AMD and other eye diseases. What of the VEGF protein implicated in wet AMD and the target of EYLEA, Avastin and Lucentis? iSONEP takes the target a step farther because S1P is linked to the production and activation of VEGF, FGF, PDGF MCP-1 IL-6, IL-8 and other growth factors implicated in the pathogenesis of wet AMD. If this pathway is neutralized, the angiogenesis, leakiness, fibrosis (scarring) and inflammation due to AMD should be effectively eliminated because a larger portion of the factors involved will be targeted, not just those pertaining to the VEGF pathway.</p>  <p>In its phase I trial, iSONEP trial subjects with wet AMD received only one injection of iSONEP. The trial met its primary endpoint of being well tolerated in all 15 patients with a maximum tolerated dosage not reached (enter the safety potential of the drug relative to the profiles of the afore-mentioned) and also met a key secondary endpoint of positive biological effects in most patients. Of special note is the patient set contained several patients who had failed to respond to Lucentis and/or Avastin treatment, a difficult patient set. Like Lucentis and Avastin, the iSONEP data appeared to stop the abnormal blood vessel growth, reduced the retinal thickness and also controlled the leakiness of the existing vessels. However, additional responses also indicated that iSONEP mitigated the fibrosis (scarred tissue) and inflammation, two key areas which would actually improve vision rather than only stopping its regression. There was also significant reduction of more than 38% in the size of the choroidal neovascular lesion in many of the test subjects. One subject experienced a 100% reduction in lesion size as of day 45, as well as complete flattening of his RPE detachment. This subject did not have to be re-injected with the one of the VEGF inhibitors for a year following the iSONEP injection. If this patient set is any indication of the efficacy of the drug, phase 2 data could be very exciting. Remember, this is after a single injection of iSONEP. If a single injection can simply reduce the number of injections of Avastin or Lucentis to once or twice a year, imagine the anxiety and side effects that will be reduced as well as the cost savings.</p>  <p><b>iSONEP&rsquo;s Current Status</b></p> <p>Lpath has recently initiated two proof-of-concept phase 2 trials for iSONEP. The first of these trials is the PEDigree trial in which iSONEP is being studied as a treatment for <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17472800"">retinal pigment epithelium detachment</a> (PED), a prominent feature of wet AMD. Lpath plans to dose 32 subjects that have PED secondary to either wet AMD or PCV. Subjects in this trial will receive up to three monthly intravitreal injections of iSONEP. The primary safety endpoint will be the tolerability of the injections, and the primary efficacy endpoint will be the percentage of subjects that experience complete flattening of their PED. In October 2011, Lpath initiated its Nexus phase II trial on iSONEP as a treatment for wet AMD. The subjects for this trial will be wet AMD patients who have not responded positively to the VEGF inhibitors Lucentis or Avastin. The subject sets will determine potential paths to approval (whether as a stand-alone treatment or synergistically with a VEGF inhibitor), dosage, safety and efficacy. The patients will be randomized into four arms: <b>1)</b> VEGF inhibitor only <b>2)</b> combination of VEGF inhibitor and lower dose of iSONEP <b>3)</b> combination of VEGF inhibitor and a higher dose of iSONEP and <b>4)</b> iSONEP alone. The endpoints of the study include changes in visual acuity, change in retinal thickness and change in lesion size.</p>  <p><strong>Lpath and iSONEP&rsquo;s Legitimization</strong></p> <p>The phase I trial was a small sample set and cannot be fully relied upon to ascertain future phase II and III trial results. However, it is a positive indication of what is possible for iSONEP and Lpath&rsquo;s remaining pipeline. Lpath is a biotech company with no product marketed and, as typical with a modern biotech, could be construed as a very risky investment. However, a <a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=197881&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1509317&amp;highlight="">partnership</a> announced in December 2010 with Pfizer helps legitimize Lpath as a solid company and strongly validates its Immune Y2 technology pipeline, in particular its iSONEP drug. The partnership already netted Lpath $14 million in January of 2011. Per current plans, this will help provide cash through June 2013, minimizing the risks associated with stock dilution seen in many biotechs in the development stage. Additional agreements in the deal could net Lpath regulatory and commercial milestone payments that could total up to $497.5 million plus double-digit royalties to iSONEP pending marketing.</p>  <p><strong>Lpath&rsquo;s Future</strong></p> <p>It is the author&rsquo;s opinion that Pfizer could be either paying these royalties potentially to its own subsidiary or to another company that might have already stepped in to purchase Lpath and its valuable platform and portfolio of <a href=""http://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/Lpath+Granted+Two+Additional+U.S.+Patents+Related+to+iSONEP+and+ASONEP+Drug+Programs/6834943.html"">patents</a>. Lpath&rsquo;s technology would have long since been legitimized and its potential in other applications such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, inflammation and other eye diseases fully realized. The blockbuster potential could become self evident as the Nexus and PEDigree trial data begins to come to light and the Immune Y2 platform is either validated or denied. The biotech arena is ripe with merger and acquisition activity as Big Pharma&rsquo;s patents expire and new first-in-class drugs become <span>available through biotechs. Gilead Sciences&rsquo; (GILD) recent acquisition of Pharmasset (VRUS) for its next generation hepatitis C treatments at a 89% premium is a prime example of the price Big Pharma is willing to pay for the &ldquo;next big thing&rdquo; in pharmaceuticals. Lpath&rsquo;s Immune Y2 platform and its potential applications treating a host of diseases places it in investors&rsquo; and Big Pharma&rsquo;s spotlights. Will Big Pharma wait until the iSONEP phase 2 data is presented before attempting to grab their prize? Or will there be an earlier press release soon stating &ldquo;XYZ Pharmaceuticals Pays Big Premium for Lpath and Its Immune Y2 Platform&rdquo;? The potential payoff could be a big piece of the ever-growing $3 billion <a href=""http://www.amd-fruehdiagnose.de/catt-study-2011-avastin-lucentis/lucentis-sales-forecasts.htm"">Lucentis pie</a> as well as a host of other potential applications.</p>  <p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.</p>"
"830911","2012-08-27 14:52:39","Consider These 3 Biotech Stocks For Potential Growth","<p>The biotech sector has been buzzing with activity lately, especially in the area of stem cell research for the treatment of cancer, tissue regeneration, and treatment of many other infections. While <strong>NeoStem (NBS)</strong> has been focusing on its contract manufacturing business, PreSERVE Phase 2 clinical trials, and VSELTM technology, <strong>Geron (GERN)</strong> has been focusing on telomerase inhibitors, aimed at stopping or inhibiting the growth of tumors. Meanwhile, <strong>Pluristem Therapeutics (PSTI)</strong> has been concentrating on its PLX cell therapy for the treatment of Buerger's disease. I will discuss each development in detail below, show how it could impact the company's bottom line, and show how this could impact each company from an investment standpoint.</p><p>NeoStem recently <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/news/neostem-announces-quarterly-results-and-business-update.html"" target=""_blank"">reported</a> its results for the second quarter and provided an update on its business operations. The company's business strategy can be broken down into two parts. The first part is a contract development and manufacturing operation (PCT) that uses state-of-the-art technology. The second part is a product development program involving advanced stem cell therapy. The platform provides the opportunity for both short-term and long-term revenues. Since the company announced its decision to divest its stake in Erye, a Chinese generic pharmaceutical manufacturer, to focus on its stem cell business, it now expects to receive $12.3 million in cash, and strengthen its balance sheet by removing $35 million in debt as part of the divestiture. At this time, NeoStem has received $6.2 million, which is half of the total $12.3 million cash purchase price.</p><p>Net loss from discontinued operations attributable to NeoStem shareholders for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 was $13.4 million and $14.8 million, respectively, or $0.10 and $0.12 per share, compared to $0.5 million and $0.8 million, or $0.01 per share for both the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2011. This loss includes a 51% share of a total $28 million non-cash asset impairment charge. Revenues from continuing operations representing the stem cell business in the U.S. were $3.4 million, compared to $2.2 million in the same quarter of the previous year. These revenues primarily represent service revenues from PCT, the contract manufacturing subsidiary. The cash loss for the quarter was $9.9 million. As of June 30, 2012 the company had cash and cash equivalents of $2.1 million, with an additional $2.5 million held in escrow. Since the end of the second quarter, NeoStem has raised an additional $7 million through the exercise of warrants and private placement. In addition, the balance of the divestiture amount is expected shortly on receipt of Chinese regulatory approvals.</p><p>NeoStem is continuing the enrollment for the PreSERVE Phase 2 clinical trial in the U.S. for post AMI (acute myocardial infarction) patients, and expects to begin receiving the initial data by the end of 2013. Peak annual worldwide sales of AMR-001, the therapy being tested, are estimated to be over $1 billion (as part of the $50 billion global regenerative medicine market), based upon a conservative estimate. Approval has been <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/news/neostem-reports-data-safety-monitoring-board-recommends-continuation-of-preserve-ami-phase-2-trial-neostem-reports-data-safety-monitoring-board-recommends-continuation-of-preserve-ami-phase-2-trial.html"" target=""_blank"">received</a> to continue the PreSERVE AMI Phase 2 clinical trial following its first interim data and safety review by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). This means that there are no safety signals that would force the discontinuation of the trial. The drug has the potential of becoming a blockbuster. In addition, Athelos, which is 80% owned by NeoStem, is working on T-cell therapeutic targeting autoimmune conditions in association with Becton Dickinson (BD). Finally, the company is working on the initial development of ""<a href=""http://www.alliancerm.org/member/neostem-inc"" target=""_blank"">VSEL! Technology</a>: Pluripotent adult stem cells can regenerate tissues and potentially treat conditions ranging from macular degeneration to liver regeneration to osteoporosis (exclusive worldwide license).""</p><p>There are several reasons NeoStem looks promising as a biotechnology investment. First, the company is focusing on several promising areas of new stem cell treatment development. Second, its contract manufacturing business brings in revenues to offset some of its drug development expenditures. Third, the contract manufacturing business could earn substantial royalties if any of the products on which it works with customers proves to be a commercial success. Now that it has shed its Chinese pharmaceutical business and renewed its focus on stem cell technology, I believe it has become a prime acquisition candidate. I urge investors looking for exposure in the biotech sector to further research and consider NeoStem today.</p><p>Geron was established in 1990 and completed its IPO in 1996. It is unusual to see a biotech company which has survived for that length of time without a product on the market. Most biotech companies in this position either fail or get acquired. Geron started out by focusing on stem cell treatments as well as oncology treatments, but decided to abandon stem cell research in 2011 due to the high cost of working on both, and decided to focus solely on oncology. It is working on the disposal of its stem cell assets, but there has been no progress reported so far. The company has two oncology drugs under development which have the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment if they are successful. The company has six Phase 2 trials currently underway.</p><p>The company's first, and most advanced drug, is called Imetelstat, a telomerase inhibitor which is currently in Phase 2 trials. Telomerase is the enzyme that enables cells to divide indefinitely without becoming unstable, thus allowing tumors to grow. There is plenty of scientific evidence to indicate that the enzyme is a key factor in the development of cancer. Geron is not the only company working on telomerase inhibitors, but it is the most advanced. Its strategy for cancer treatment is to stop or inhibit the growth of tumors. Imetelstat is currently in trials for the treatment of four different types of cancer, including breast cancer, NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) for solid tumors, multiple myeloma, and essential thrombocythemia for malignancies related to hematology. The data from all four trials is expected to become available over the next twelve months.</p><p>GRN1005 is an LRP-directed peptide drug combination aimed at treating brain cancer, which is currently very difficult to treat, because existing cancer drugs cannot penetrate the barrier between circulating blood in the body and the fluids of the brain. GRN1005 uses the LRP-1 transport mechanism, which uses a particular protein to bypass the blood-brain barrier and deliver cancer drugs to the brain. GRN1005 is now in Phase 2 trials to test the effectiveness of treatment in breast and lung cancer that has spread to the brain.</p><p>Geron's approach to oncology is unique, and positive results from any of the trials could potentially boost the price of the stock. Conversely, there is also limited protection for the stock price because of the number of trials that are in progress simultaneously. Additionally, failure in one trial may be construed as a possible failure in other trials utilizing the same drug which could be catastrophic for the share price. I urge risk tolerant investors interested in Geron to conduct further research and be prepared to hold for twelve months or longer.</p><p>Pluristem Therapeutics has recently reported promising new developments that make it worthy of further research. The company has <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/17/idUS150479+17-Aug-2012+HUG20120817"" target=""_blank"">received</a> approval from the Indian government to conduct Phase 2 trials using its PLX cell therapy for Buerger's disease, an inflammation of the small blood vessels of hands and feet, which currently has no treatment and commonly leads to gangrene and amputation in nearly 50% of cases. The company has applied for Orphan Drug status for the treatment of the condition, which is widespread in India and South-East Asia. The disease has a strong link to smoking bidis (hand-rolled raw tobacco wrapped in leaf), and more than 40% of the Indian population smokes them. The majority of the affected population is under 40 years old. If the trials are successful, the company will gain exposure to a vast new market.</p><p>The company also recently <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/equity-briefing-pluristem-partners-prestigious-140002735.html"" target=""_blank"">announced</a> that people affected with peripheral arterial disease, or PAD, may soon have an alternative to <strong>Bristol-Myer Squibb's (BMY)</strong> troubled anti-clotting drug, Plavix. Plavix has been identified as having a long list of negative side effects, such as bleeding, which can occur in 5% of users. Severe allergic reactions and difficulty breathing are also common side effects. There is currently no alternative to Plavix, and users must use it throughout their lifetime or risk recurrence of the disease. Pluristem Therapeutics has announced an alliance with the world-famous Paul Ehrlich Institute in Germany, which has long been associated with Nobel Prize winning research. The company is among the first biotechs chosen to conduct clinical trials under the sponsorship of the Institute, and will soon start Phase 2 trials for intermittent claudication (IC), the painful first sign/symptom of PAD. PAD affects over 5% of the American population, and up to 14% of PAD sufferers do not respond to Plavix.</p><p>Bone marrow transplants are <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/790331-pluristem-s-cell-therapy-for-bone-marrow-a-blockbuster-in-the-making"" target=""_blank"">traumatic and very expensive</a>, and despite the significant amount being spent on research, there are currently no viable alternatives for indications requiring such. Patients often remain sick for up to one year after the transplant, and face a host of complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), where the body rejects the treatment. Companies like <strong>Pfizer (PFE)</strong> and <strong>Eli Lilly (LLY)</strong> are trying to develop substitutes for chemotherapy, while other companies are focusing solely on treating chemotherapy symptoms with products like Neulasta by <strong>Amgen (AMGN)</strong> or Emend by <strong>Merck (MRK)</strong>. Data presented by Pluristem Therapeutics for a viable replacement for bone marrow transplants suggests that intramuscular injection of its PLX cells showed positive results on a range of blood diseases that included failures from chemotherapy and radiation treatment. The company is reasonably well funded with around $42 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company has filed for Orphan Drug status, which means that its PLX cell treatment could be approved more quickly and, if successful, the treatment could be on the market in as little as one year with added protection from competition by the FDA.</p><p>The three companies discussed above are showing much potential for growth. If you are looking for exposure in the volatile biotech sector, I would recommend exploring each company further and watching closely for additional developments that could lead to buying opportunities.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

"318915","2012-01-11 13:48:56","'Top of The Class' Biotechs For 2012","<p>With 2011 fading in the distance, biotech investors look back on yet another volatile and unpredictable trading year and hope to see more green than red in their selections. As the year waned, many chose to offset their capital gains by selling their failures and also to enjoy the fruits of their wise decisions by taking profits and closing/reducing successful positions. With 2012 upon them, these investors will be looking to open new positions using the wisdom from last year&rsquo;s successes and disasters to guide their decisions. The biotech sector is ripe with potential for gains of many hundreds of percentages for wise and/or lucky positions along with the possible corresponding losses and accompanying heartbreaks. Success can breed more success while failures can frustrate to the point of breaking traders&rsquo; spirits and portfolios. </p>  <p>More so than with any other sector, a biotech investor&rsquo;s best friend, apart from luck, is research and due diligence. There are hosts of resources available to view and analyze trial data, company market capitalizations, earnings (and potential earnings), share structure, analyst opinions, competitor drug data, drug marketability and more. With some of the smaller microcap biotechs the decision often comes down to &ldquo;is this even a legitimate company?&rdquo; and with others the successful investor must decide &ldquo;okay, I believe this drug or medical device will be approved but will it have sufficient marketability to provide real earnings for the company?&rdquo; The research necessary, questions and concerns are often mind-boggling. Investors wade through the research and ultimately must decide if their cost/benefit analysis justifies a position and what type and duration of position must be chosen. Savvy investors looking for lower market capitalization biotechs with solid potential for the upcoming year may be interested in the following biotechs that can be construed as &ldquo;top of the class&rdquo; relative to their peer biotechs in their fields with huge potential and multiple catalysts coming in 2012.</p>  <p><b>Lpath, Inc. (LPTN.OB) &ndash; Class Leader in L</b><b>ipidomics-based Antibody Therapeutics in the Blockbuster-Potential Wet AMD Market</b></p>  <p>Lpath, Inc. and its Immune Y2 technology captured the biotech world&rsquo;s attention in December 2010 after it announced a partnership with Pfizer (PFE) to develop and potentially market Lpath&rsquo;s wet AMD drug, iSONEP. Per the <a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=197881&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1509317&amp;highlight="">agreement</a>, Pfizer provided Lpath with $14 million upfront and Lpath would be eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments that could potentially add up to about $500 million not including the double-digit royalties from the sales of the drug if approved. Lpath announced the receipt of the $14 million in January 2011, setting the tone for the year for this small cap biotech and giving it broader exposure by putting it on many biotech investor watch lists. This agreement at least partially legitimizes Lpath&rsquo;s Y2 technology and the iSONEP drug specifically as the Big Pharma leader recognizes the drug&rsquo;s potential. The agreement also gives Pfizer the first right of refusal to Lpath&rsquo;s cancer drug, ASONEP, which utilizes the same bioactive lipid signaling approach as iSONEP. Biotech traders view the agreement as being a huge positive as Pfizer wouldn&rsquo;t be investing such a large amount of money or time in such an endeavor without having a great deal of confidence in the technology.</p>  <p>Information on their &ldquo;top of the class&rdquo; deserving Immune Y2 technology can be found on the company&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.lpath.com/about-lpath/our-novel-approach/"">website</a>. Basically, iSONEP itself is a monoclonal antibody targeting Sphingosine 1 Phosphate (S1P). S1P is a bioactive lipid that is a key component of the sphingolipid signaling cascade. In the wet AMD, S1P has been implicated as having many actions that promote inflammation and dysregulated angiogenesis. It additionally supports the survival of multiple cell types including fibroblasts, endothelial and inflammatory cells that participate in the dysfunctional processes of wet AMD and other eye diseases. If this pathway is tied up or neutralized, the angiogenesis, leakiness, scarring and inflammation due to AMD should be effectively eliminated because a larger portion of related factors involved will be targeted, not just those pertaining to the VEGF pathway that EYLEA, Avastin and Lucentis target due to the fact that S1P is linked to the production and activation of the growth factors VEGF, FGF, PDGF MCP-1 IL-6, IL-8 often implicated in the pathogenesis of wet AMD.</p>  <p>Phase 2 trials for iSONEP are already underway. They&rsquo;re supported by strong phase I data in which the drug was well tolerated in all 15 patients with positive biological effects seen in most patients. The patient set chosen was a difficult one in which several of the patients had failed to respond positively to either Avastin or Lucentis. The drug appeared to stop the abnormal blood vessel growth, reduced the retinal thickness and also controlled the leakiness of the existing vessels, which are trademark effects of the ailment. However, as an added bonus the drug did something that neither Lucentis nor Avastin have shown clinical abilities to do. It mitigated the scarred tissue and inflammation, two key areas that could actually improve vision rather than only stopping its regression. If phase 2 data show comparable results to the phase I data particularly in the areas of vision improvement (<a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=197881&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1617677&amp;highlight="">2nd phase 2 trial</a>) and in the case of <a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=197881&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1611349&amp;highlight="">RPE detachment phase 2 trial</a> an improvement is seen in retinal pigment epithelium detachment secondary to wet AMD or polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), the company will start generating phenomenal interest by potentially answering a large unmet need in a near-blockbuster market. Pfizer and many biotech investors are already watching the company closely and have already positioned themselves for success in the company. Interim and perhaps even final data obtained in 2012 will be huge catalysts for the company and could justify those decisions.</p>  <p><strong>Curis, Inc. (CRIS) &ndash; Class Leader in Advanced Basal Cell Carcinoma Treatment</strong></p>  <p>Curis, Inc. had an outstanding 2011 starting with pivotal (suitable for regulatory submission) <a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=123198&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1540868&amp;highlight="">Phase II data</a> reported for vismodegib for the treatment of advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) by collaborator Genentech (RHHBY.PK). The vismodegib trial met its primary endpoint by achieving a target overall response rate by shrinking advanced BCC tumors in a pre-defined percentage of people in the study. The safety profile was noted as being consistent with previous trials with few adverse reactions with long-term observations still underway. Curis&rsquo; pipeline is centered on attacking cancer via its signaling drug pathway technologies. Vismodegib&rsquo;s action is based on regulating the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Aberrant Hedgehog signaling is implicated in more than 90 percent of BCC cases as well as many other cancers. An excellent overview of this specific signaling pathway and its implications in other cancers may be found <a href=""http://www.abcam.com/index.html?pageconfig=resource&amp;rid=10858&amp;pid=10039"">here</a>. </p>  <p>More detailed clinical data for vismodegib was first <a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=123198&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1575307&amp;highlight="">released in June</a> and offers real hope to those suffering from the disease. Data indicated an overall response rate, as assessed by an independent review facility, showing vismodegib substantially shrank tumors or healed visible lesions with observed response rates for 43 percent of patients in the laBCC cohort (71 patients in which surgery would result in substantial physical deformity) and 30 percent of patients in the mBCC cohort (33 patients in which the BCC had metastasized). An additional notation in the data stated that there were no residual BCC cells in sampled biopsies of 54 percent of laBCC patients.</p>  <p>Genentech <a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=123198&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1605692&amp;highlight="">submitted the NDA</a> in September and announced FDA <a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=123198&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1628185&amp;highlight="">acceptance of the NDA</a> in November with a priority review of the application. A PDUFA date of March 8, 2012 was assigned to allow completion of the NDA review and potentially grant marketing approval of vismodegib. Curis received $8 million as a milestone payment from Genentech for the NDA acceptance and will receive additional milestone payments upon approval as well as royalty payments once the drug is marketed. In December, Genentech also announced they had submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for vismodegib. This application entitled Curis to an additional $6 million milestone payment. Additional milestone payments will be paid to Curis if the MAA is accepted and more royalties will be paid subsequently once the drug is marketed.</p>  <p><b>Celsion Corporation (CLSN) &ndash; Class Leader for Novel Primary Liver Cancer Treatment</b></p>  <p>Celsion Corporation&rsquo;s ThermoDox treatment for primary liver cancer places it at the &ldquo;top of its class&rdquo; for its approach to attacking the disease. There are approximately 20,000 cases of primary liver cancer diagnosed annually in the U.S. and 40,000 cases in Europe with worldwide diagnoses increasing annually to about 700,000, a huge market potential and area of need. The ThermoDox technology attempts to address the issue of systemic poisoning of the patients receiving standard chemotherapy for the cancer, which harms the healthy system along with the cancer tumor and necessitates a reduced dosage to maintain a patient-tolerant level. ThermoDox is a heat-activated liposomal encapsulation of the chemotherapy agent, <a href=""http://www.drugs.com/mtm/doxorubicin.html"">doxorubicin</a>, which is already approved to treat a wide range of cancers. The ThermoDox solution is administered intravenously and allowed to accumulate in the tumor tissue as it has much higher microvascular permeability than normal tissue. Localized hyperthermia is then induced via a narrowly focused RF (radio frequency) beam that raise the temperature at the tumor site to 39.5-42 degrees Celsius, which releases the entrapped doxorubicin from the liposome. This causes a discreet, high concentration of the drug at the tumor site targeting it while minimizing the levels of the drug that the remainder of the body is exposed to.

(GALE) &ndash; Class Leader in Adjuvant Immunotherapy Breast Cancer Treatment</strong></p>  <p>Galena Biopharma, formerly Rxi Pharmaceuticals until a <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/sec-filings/110926/RXI-PHARMACEUTICALS-CORP_8-K/b88321exv3w1.htm"">name change</a> and company restructuring in September, turned a lot of heads in the biotech investment community in 2011 with its phase II NeuVax adjuvant immunotherapy breast cancer drug trials. Over 200,000 women per year are <a href=""http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/BreastCancer/OverviewGuide/breast-cancer-overview-key-statistics"">diagnosed with breast cancer</a> in the U.S. with about 40,000 dying annually, a tremendous number with much unmet need. Only about 25% of these, those with HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) 3+ over-expression, are eligible for Genentech&rsquo;s approved <a href=""http://www.gene.com/gene/products/information/oncology/herceptin/factsheet.html"">Herceptin</a> (plus standard of care chemotherapy), which had revenues of more than $5 billion in 2010. Galena&rsquo;s NeuVax targets the remaining 50% of HER2-positive patients (those that are HER2 1+ and HER2 2+), which is administered with the adjuvant standard of care. Like Herceptin, NeuVax is given to improve disease-free and overall survival in its targeted patient set after the initial standard of care treatment. An immunotherapy agent, it is given to stimulate the immunity system to attack any residual or new cancer cells remaining after the standard of care treatment procedures. Please see the company <a href=""http://www.galenabiopharma.com/technology#immunotherapy"">website</a> for a detailed description of the drug&rsquo;s mode of action.</p>  <p>Phase II data on the ongoing trial was <a href=""http://investors.galenabiopharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=630974"">presented on December 7th</a> at the 34th Annual CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in San Antonio, Texas. The 60-month data indicated that the vaccine has an acceptable safety profile and is well tolerated. It demonstrated efficacy in preventing breast cancer recurrence in optimally dosed and subsequently boosted patients. The patient set was comprised of 108 patients in the vaccine group and 79 patients in the control group. Of the 53 patients who received at least one booster inoculation (given once every six months because of waning immunity once the initial treatment protocol had completed), a statistically significant disease-free survival rate of 95.9% was seen versus 79.7% in the control group. It should be noted when considering this data set that patients in the trial were node positive (adjacent lymph nodes contained cancer cells which is a sign of potential metastasis) or high-risk node negative breast cancer patients with any level of HER2 expression (IHC 1+, 2+, or 3+), and rendered disease-free after standard adjuvant therapies. Note that the IHC 3+ patients were included in this set, which is not an intended target population data set and will be an excluded population for the phase III trial. This part of the patient set likely decreased the efficacy of the vaccine group, and the disease-free survival rate of 95.9% would likely have been even more impressive without these patients&rsquo; inclusion. For more information on the combined node-positive and node-negative phase 2 trials that were run simultaneously, please see this <a href=""http://neuvax.com/data.html"">data</a> presented at ASCO 2011.</p>  <p>Having the smallest market cap of the &ldquo;top of the class candidates&rdquo;, Galena stock likely has the largest upside potential and/or volatility in 2012 with a current market capitalization of $19.6 million as of market close on January 4th.

This SPA designation gives the company better guidance and a more clearly defined set of goals in order to determine if the phase III data will be acceptable to support regulatory approval of NeuVax. The phase III trial, set to commence in 1H 2012, will be termed the PRESENT trial (Prevention of Recurrence in Early-Stage, Node-Positive Breast Cancer with Low to Intermediate HER2 Expression with NeuVax Treatment). The enrollment initiation for this trial and continuing data acquisition from the on-going phase 2 trial will both be key catalysts for the company in 2012.</p>  <p>Appropriate entry positions and timing for any of these &ldquo;top of the class&rdquo; candidates will be key. The above information on these &ldquo;valedictorian-potential&rdquo; biotechs is a good starting point and vastly narrows down potential candidates for 2012 investment. However, additional investor research and due diligence will be necessary in order to ultimately make investment decisions on which, if any, of these companies fit into the biotech investor&rsquo;s portfolio for mid to long term investment. Overall market conditions, of course, will play a key part in whether the potential gains (or losses) are exaggerated or muted. However, novel drug development is difficult, time-consuming and expensive and the successful late-stage status of the key drugs for each of these candidates could make them highly attractive if not now, then closer to their catalyst dates for 2012. Under the radar for now, that could change rapidly as any of these companies release anticipated or unanticipated news whether in the form of trial data, partnerships, licensing, buyout or regulatory approval. Good luck to these &ldquo;top of the class&rdquo; candidates and their possible impending graduations to the next level and congratulations to any investor &ldquo;friends or family&rdquo; that could be enjoying the ride to the top with them!</p>  <p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.</p>"
"834691","2012-08-29 04:29:54","Biotech: Mega-Caps Show Investors The Way","<p>Having been an active investor in both the biotech and tech industries, it is my opinion that more fortunes have been won-- and lost-- in biotech than most any other industry. I might also add that the ebb and flow happens in a compressed fashion that renders the &quot;beta&quot; (implied volatility) for most of these stocks suitable only for intrepid investors. As a biotech investor, you knew that, right? If you've invested in even the smallest handful of biotech stocks, then you have no doubt experienced volatility. It just comes with the territory. As such, the adage &quot;nothing ventured nothing gained&quot; rings truer with biotech than any other segment. Just ask Dendreon (DNDN) investors whereby, after promising trial data and perceived market potential, the stock rocketed from $0.90 to over $30.00 in a matter of six months. So, large sums can be made in biotech-- mostly among traders who understand the risks they assume, have a working knowledge of the biotech and investment industries, are sure to put a stop-loss behind their positions, and finally, are unafraid of going against the grain when it comes to selling and buying. That trader who booked a huge gain in Dendreon would have lost most of it had they held on. A good trader would have moved on after the gain was booked. The stock ultimately dropped back to $4.00 in the space of a few months.</p><p><strong>Gauging Risk: Large Cap Investments, Small Cap &quot;Specs&quot;</strong></p><p>If you are going to play the biotech investor game, you will first and foremost need to recognize that any investment in the small cap biotech universe is speculative, and any process should include ample due diligence as well as an exit strategy. There is a place for long-term investing in biotech, but it exists with mid to large cap companies with a proven track record of managing a diversified portfolio of treatments through the approval process and distribution in the market place. Any reasonable candidate would have a formidable stable of revenue-generating products with ample generic protection for its portfolio. Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen Idec (BIIB) would be the best examples of diversified biotech powerhouses. Smoother revenue and earnings trajectories have afforded terrific returns to shareholders over long stretches of time. This has endeared them to institutional investors and fund managers (who don't have the mandate to shoot for the moon with more speculative picks).</p><p>A closer look at these three large biotechs is revealing. They are usually anchored by one outstanding and hugely profitable treatment. They also have a constellation of smaller and mid-market &quot;niche&quot; treatments and a decent pipeline as well. See chart below:</p><p><strong>Company Market Cap &quot;Anchor&quot; Drug</strong></p><p>Amgen $64.5 Billion Epogen</p><p>Gilead $42.4 Billion Vistide</p><p>Biogen $34.3 Billion Rituxan</p><p>What is a consistent characteristic of the three is that the path to consistent profitability was generated via a breakthrough drug that paved the way for the company to more diversified channels of revenue. It makes sense if you think about it: the profits can be plowed back into R&amp;D or for smaller acquisitions that enable a legacy of future profitable treatments. For Amgen, it could not be the company it is today without the success of &quot;Epogen&quot;. And for Biogen, &quot;Rituxan&quot; was instrumental in generating revenues necessary to create the company it is today.</p><p>Ultimately, for biotech investors the search begins with smaller companies that show the promise of getting approval and, hopefully, success in the market place. We are not here to talk about &quot;steady eddy&quot; performers, but about candidates that have the ability to add a potential zero to the right side of your invested capital. It is the rapid escalation in value that is so compelling to biotech investors that keeps them coming back to smaller more speculative issues. It is a fact that biotech lies at the creative front of business, a place where science and business merge to form that combustible concoction of potential, that attracts some of the sharpest minds in industry. So let's talk about a couple candidates with the potential to make that trade a spectacular, albeit volatile ride to investment gains.</p><p><strong>Two Candidates with Outsized Potential: OncoSec Medical (ONCS.OB) &amp; NeoStem Inc. (NBS)</strong></p><p><strong>OncoSec Medical Incorporated</strong></p><p>OncoSec (ONCS.OB) is yet another San Diego based biotech with aspirations on the treatment of various skin cancers. Where it diverges from the other market entrants is its focus on a proprietary therapeutic delivery technology that centers on the notion that delivery methods haven't really kept up with advances in immunotherapic treatments. Think Medtronic (MED) or the medical device division of Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) as the best analogy as a company that specialize in the &quot;razor blade&quot;, or &quot;picks and shovel&quot; approach to treatment. (Treatments might change, but a good delivery mechanism provides for steady earnings). By focusing on the device that delivers the chemotherapeutic agent, OncoSec is essentially delivering a next generation platform that makes treatment less intrusive and more effective--important when many of these cancers occur on the area most prone to skin cancer: the face. This is something that surgeons and their patients can easily rally behind. It is hard enough to have operable cancer on the most visible part of the human body, let alone the awkward healing process for intrusive surgery. A more effective treatment with tremendous cosmetic benefits are probably the future.</p><p>OncoSec has <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/clinical/clinical-trials/"">three Phase II clinical trials</a> underway with its OMS ElectroImmunotherapy product (recently renamed &quot;ImmunoPulse&quot;). Oncosec's device using electroporation technology (stimulates cells to engage better absorption rates of an anti-cancer therapy) has shown efficacy in patient treatment outcomes with respect to the disfigurement and functional impact of existing surgical procedures. The proprietary electroporation delivery system also better enables uptake by cells for powerful cancer fighting agents. Results have been promising with 90% of treated lesions demonstrating local control and 53% of patients with metastatic showing objective response. 16% of treated patients showed complete regression according to <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/technology/immunopulse/"">recent</a> data.</p><p>OncoSec 's stature as a small cap player (approximately $17M at present) belies its potential market expansion as the drug delivery component of novel immunotherapies have not evolved. OncoSec could be a hidden gem if it can capitalize on its promise as a legitimate device maker-- especially since the consensus among many analysts is that we are at &quot;early innings&quot; in immunotherapy treatments of cancer.</p><p><strong>NeoStem, Inc.</strong></p><p>NeoStem is a more established player than OncoSec, but it has faced challenges in its treatments in the development of proprietary cellular therapies in cardiovascular disease, immunology, and regenerative medicine. While it wields a market cap of $88M its stock price has languished in the sub-dollar range for months as the market takes a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach to its current product candidate, AMR-001, which is in Phase II trials to treat damaged heart muscles following acute myocardial infarction.</p><p>NeoStem's appeal lies in the market's reduced expectations, providing a decent entry point at current valuations. What the market may be missing is that NeoStem has several avenues to growth: While it has its own promising cell therapy, it combines this with operational expertise as a leader in the manufacture of cell therapies. It touts Baxter as one of many clients that have signed on to receive treatments that have emanated from 65,000 square feet of manufacturing capacity. Another division, also, is in the business of collecting and storing adult stem cells as well as cord blood from infants. Some of the most successful businesses have this component to their business model: proprietary storage capabilities. While the excitement over stem cells waxes and wanes, it would be hard to dispute that, in some capacity, expertise in this domain will be valuable to future generations.</p><p>Given that NeoStem had such high expectations, it might take a bit more convincing in the form of pure results to move the needle. OncoSec might seem to be the fresher choice given tremendous momentum in immunotherapy. Regardless, both firms are solid - but speculative-- candidates to add to a biotech or biopharmaceutical portfolio that has growth in mind.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[ONCS.OB]], [[NBS]], [[JNJ]].

"1584912","2013-07-30 15:08:57","Great Leadership And Massive Opportunities Makes This Hire Terrific","<p>If you are a CEO of a biotechnology company and are focusing on a new discipline, then you want to surround yourself with the best-of-the-best in that particular space. <b>NeoStem</b> <b>(NBS)</b> is no different. The company is developing a product-- AMR-001-- that, if successful, could be the first FDA approved cell therapy product.</p><p>NeoStem not only needs to produce solid clinical results, but the company needs to answer any questions that the FDA might have along the way, and needs experience at all levels of management to ensure that its products are developed effectively. These facts are why the <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/7112462-neostem-appoints-stephen-w-potter-as-executive-vice-president"">appointment</a> of Stephen W. Potter as the Executive Vice President is so important for NeoStem.</p><p><b>A Look At NeoStem's New Hire</b></p><p>Back in March, I <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1285521-cell-therapy-leader-stephen-potter-talks-osiris-neostem-and-the-industry-itself"">interviewed Stephen Potter</a> when he joined NeoStem's Board of Directors. Mr. Potter is definitely one of the most decorated in the cell therapy space. His previous role was as the Senior Vice President of Operations and Corporate Development at <strong>Osiris Therapeutics</strong> (OSIR). In other words, he was instrumental in the development of Osiris Therapeutics' cell therapy product, Prochymal, for GvHD in children. This is important for NeoStem, because Potter knows the steps that need to be taken and the questions that might be asked by regulators.</p><p>Moreover, in his previous role at Osiris, Potter was responsible for the launch and overall management of the company's Biosurgery business. For Osiris, all of its $11.5 million in annual revenue was created from the Biosurgery segment. NeoStem, with its PCT manufacturing business, and its $13 million in revenue over the last 12 months, has a much larger market opportunity than Osiris has with its Biosurgery segment. This should allow Potter to excel and work his magic in marketing and development.</p><p><b>The Opportunity Is Great For NeoStem</b></p><p>As I explained <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1539642-an-overlooked-metric-in-biotechnology-that-you-should-utilize"">in this article</a>, Osiris Therapeutics' Prochymal, which is already approved in New Zealand and Canada, will be hard-pressed to earn $50 million in peak global sales for GvHD in children. NeoStem's AMR-001 has <a href=""http://www.neostem.com/research-and-development/amorcyte/"">peak sales potential</a> in excess of $1 billion. It is a potential product that treats patients immediately following a heart attack. AMR-001 is used for the prevention of downstream adverse events after acute myocardial infarction. This cardiovascular disorder is a massive unmet medical need, and if NeoStem can continue to prove that AMR-001 works to prevent heart muscle deterioration, then it will be FDA approved.</p><p>Potter will aid in AMR-001's development, including clinical research, and ensure that the clinical studies are executed correctly. Currently, AMR-001 is being tested in a Phase II trial and should be near completing its enrollment. Once enrolled, we shall receive data within eight months, meaning that in early 2014 the future of this company should be known.</p><p>Personally, I expect a successful study. Last year, the company disclosed that it had found a threshold dose of AMR-001, and that not one patient experienced a deterioration of heart muscle function when treated with 10 million cells. However 30-40% of patients experienced deterioration when treated with fewer than 10 million cells.</p><p>The structure of AMR-001 is similar to <strong>Baxter's</strong> (BAX) cell therapy product, which uses CD34+ cells, and both target cardiovascular disorders. Baxter's cell therapy product, developed by Dr. Douglas Losordo, was successful in its <span>Phase II trial. In the study, patients with refractory angina and chronic myocardial ischemia saw increased exercise capacity and reduced angina episodes. Previously, these endpoints had never been met, which is a true testament to the potential of CD34+ cells in treating cardiovascular disorders, and further validates the approach of NeoStem's AMR-001.</p><p><b>The Center Of Controversy</b></p><p>With any new type of treatment, there is going to be controversy: It is natural. NeoStem's VSELs are in the early phases of development, and most of what we know stems from preclinical research and tests on mice. However, this fact has not stopped some from taking extremely bullish and bearish sides. Personally, I have been on the bullish side as I believe that, if successful, VSELs could be used to treat a wide array of degenerative diseases. Therefore, for the sake of medicine, I hope it works.</p><p>Dr. Irving Weissman recently completed a study on mice where he found no pluripotent cells and questioned the overall existence of VSELs in mice. The founder of VSELs, Mariusz Ratajczak, said, &quot;Weissman has never visited my lab to witness exactly how we carry out the method&quot;. Others believe that it is the responsibility of Ratajczak and NeoStem to share their protocol to reproduce VSELs in laboratory work. To me, this &quot;lack of sharing&quot; is the center of VSEL controversy.</p><p>Russell Taichman, a researcher in dental medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, states, &quot;I don't see the controversy - we have seen bone grow&quot;. Taichman's statement is true: In a preclinical study with mice, VSELs created bone growth, which was its primary goal. Unfortunately, with patents, clinical studies, and billions of dollars at stake, I don't find it surprising that the researchers have not openly discussed the exact protocol to reproduce and use VSELs.</p><p>While I am not a scientist and could not possibly comprehend the process involved with these cells, I do know that every company in history has been a bit secretive regarding its main products. Hence, Coca-Cola does not openly disclose to PepsiCo how to make Coke. Therefore, why should NeoStem or the VSEL founders be open with their protocol?</p><p>This brings me to another point, and that is my excitement that Dr. Losordo (recently appointed to NeoStem's Scientific Advisory Board) and Potter will be on board while NeoStem advances VSELs. While VSELs is far down the pipeline and is hardly responsible for any of NeoStem's current valuation, this is a property that could be very lucrative to the company long-term. Neither Dr. Losordo nor Potter are strangers to controversy. Osiris' Prochymal has been debated for years, and had to endure many years of vigorous studies to become the first cell therapy product to earn a marketing approval.</p><p>In my interview with Losordo, he talked about the challenges faced with developing CD34+ cells, as many were very skeptical-- and at several points he had to virtually sell the data. Now, with the data produced in its <span>Phase II study, Baxter's CD34+ cell therapy product is among the company's most promising of candidates. Thus, as a NeoStem shareholder I am happy to have both Losordo and Potter working with the company, and using their unique expertise to ensure that NeoStem's pipeline has the best shot of succeeding.</p><p><i>All references to quotes and studies above can be found <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/doubt-cast-over-tiny-stem-cells-1.13435"">in this Nature article</a>.</i></p><p><b>Final Thoughts</b></p><p>The reason that Baxter's story is important is because Dr. Losordo is now working with NeoStem. This means that not only has NeoStem hired an industry vet with exceptional launch and development success in Stephen Potter, but also has a prominent physician who played a major role in the development of Baxter's now successful cell therapy product.</p><p>I would argue that no one is more educated and has performed more research on CD34+ cell development than Dr. Douglas Losordo. Hence, NeoStem has significantly strengthened its leadership and advisory team with the best of the best in the regenerative cell therapy space. The company, with three different promising divisions, is giving itself the best possible chance to become the leader in what could become a massive space. With a market cap of just $140 million, such opportunities are very rare, as is such leadership experience.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[NBS]].

It also means that Canadians, especially the 9 million <a href=""http://www.diabetes.ca/diabetes-and-you/what/prevalence/"">diabetics</a> or pre-diabetics, can now enjoy the benefits of stevia with its zero calorie and zero glycemic index. Prior to November 30th stevia was only available in Canada in natural health products. Health Canada received three separate food additive <a href=""http://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/Suppliers-Welcome-Canadian-Approval-of-Stevia.html"">submissions</a> for approval for the use of steviol glycosides as a tabletop sweetener and a sweetener in a variety of unstandardized foods.</p><p>With Health Canada's approval stevia continues its growth to be the worldwide natural zero calorie alternative to sugar, high fructose corn <span>syrup</span> and artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame and Splenda. According to Elaine Watson at <i><a href=""http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Market/Suppliers-gear-up-as-Health-Canada-gives-the-green-light-for-stevia-in-Canada"">Food Navigator</a></i> within the next few months new markets will open for stevia, such as India, <span>Thailand</span> and South Africa as they are expecting regulatory approval. With the large populations of the new markets slated to open, and the growing consumer demand for healthy alternatives to <span>sugar</span> - this will be a huge win for stevia producers. At this time stevia's largest <a href=""http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Market/Suppliers-gear-up-as-Health-Canada-gives-the-green-light-for-stevia-in-Canada"">market</a> is the U.S, though sales in Europe, Mexico, <span>China</span> and Brazil are <span>expanding</span>. A<span>nd </span>now with Canada's approval, companies should soon be clamoring to get its stevia-based products on grocers' shelves as quickly in 2013 as possible. <span></p><p><span>So </span>how can an investor profit from stevia's popularity and growth? The major bottlers such as <strong>Coca-Cola (KO)</strong> or <strong>PepsiCo (PEP)</strong> are already using stevia as a sugar substitute in a number of their products, and it appears they will continue to add more to their low calorie or zero calorie pipelines. However, since the two bottlers control such a high market share already, it probably won't affect the stock price as it would smaller companies. Following are some companies that could see their stocks move upward. The list includes growers and producers focusing on developing a sweeter stevia product, or food manufacturers and bottlers adding stevia to more of their product lines.</p><p><strong>Monster Beverage Corporation</strong> <strong>(MNST)</strong> is hardly considered a small company, but it is in a great position to benefit from the Canadian approval with its line of stevia-sweetened Blue Sky Sodas and Hansen's low calorie juices, which are already on the market. Monster is the leading distributor of energy drinks with its line of Monster Energy, Java Monster, X-Presso Monster, as well as soda and juices through its Hansen's, Blue Sky sodas, and Hubert's Lemonades. Monster carries a diet energy line, Monster Zero Ultra, Monster Low carb, and Monster Absolutely Zero, all sweetened with the artificial sweetener <a href=""http://www.energyfiend.com/sugar-free-energy-drink-chart"">Acesulfame - K.</a> With the changing consumer demand for a healthier alternative to sugar, Monster may want to look in its rear view mirror at <strong><span>Starbucks' </span>(SBUX)</strong> energy drink, Refreshers, which is a natural product and uses stevia as its sweetener. It may start catching up, as it becomes a more desirable choice for the new generation of consumers. With countries approving stevia's use, it also gives Monster a golden opportunity to enhance its product line and attract new customers with a healthy alternative. Stevia is not new to Monster; it is already used it in many of its products. Time will tell if Monster will set itself apart from the rest of the field and develop more products, especially its diet Monster energy drinks, sweetened with stevia.</p><p>Monster Beverage is an $8.84 billion market cap company. Even though the stock has been hammered over the past six months, down over 30%, partly due to the tragedy of the 14-year old girl who died after consuming two Monster Energy beverages, it still has a rather high P/E ratio of 28.4 compared to the industry sector average of 15.1. Monster Beverage announced its <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-11-07/monster-beverage-sinks-as-sales-slowed-in-3q"">net income</a> rose 5% in the third quarter, to $86.1 million, or $0.47 per share, from $82.4 million, or $0.44 cents per share. Revenue, which rose almost 30% in the last three quarters, increased to $541.9 million from $474.7 million. Some analysts are beginning to think that the worst may be over for Monster, and on Dec. 6th <a href=""http://www.streetinsider.com/rating_history.php?q=MNST"">Consumer Edge Research</a> upgraded Monster from a neutral to an outperform. It will be interesting to see if other analysts follow suit, as the overall rating still remains neutral. Earlier this year there was some talk about <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/30/coca-cola-monster-acquisition_n_1466018.html"">a takeover target</a> by Coca-Cola, which helped the stock price to raise over $83.00 per share. However, Coca-Cola quickly squashed the rumors, perhaps due to Monster's high multiple. Now with the stock price down to $51.54 per share, its multiple lower, and its <a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/p/348conameu.html"">price-to-book value</a> at 9.94 being well below the industry average of 25.1, it may be time for Coca-Cola to re-examine its interest in the company. If so, I'd look for the stock to rise again.</p><p><strong>Sunwin Stevia International (<span>SUWN.OB</span>)</strong>, based in Qufu, China, a vertically-integrated manufacturer of stevia products and traditional Chinese medicines, announced the installation of new high-tech production lines to expand its stevia production capacity to 1,300 metric tons, including 500 metric tons of high-grade stevioside Rebaudioside A (Reb A), and 500 metric tons of steviosin, a stevioside extract used by the pharmaceutical industry. Sunwin began its expansion project in April anticipating an improvement in demand for stevia as a healthy low calorie sweetener and is now poised to capitalize on the industry's upward trend. With Canada's approval of stevia, it becomes apparent that the company was correct as stevia continues to grow in worldwide acceptance. Sunwin's new stevioside extraction line uses a state-of-the-art crystallization process that substantially reduces the production time while increasing product yield leading to a substantial reduction in overall processing costs as utilization rates increase. Sunwin has begun trial production of its new lines and anticipates its added production capabilities to be fully operational in the first quarter of 2013.</p><p>In August Sunwin entered into a worldwide stevia distribution agreement with <strong>WILD Flavors,</strong> giving WILD a non-exclusive worldwide right as a distributor to market and resell all Sunwin stevia products. Sunwin is also developing 6 new <a href=""http://www.foodproductiondaily.com/Processing/Sunwin-Stevia-pours-cash-into-production"">formulations</a> in conjunction with WILD with the goal of penetrating the $10.3 billion <a href=""http://www.bakeryandsnacks.com/Formulation/Sunwin-to-broaden-stevia-presence-through-Chinese-private-label-bakery"">Chinese bakery market</a> by marketing to manufacturers to develop private label <span>products</span> - a move that the company sees will bolster its domestic production base in China.</p><p>Sunwin, with a market cap of $45.1 million, has had an impressive 3-month run, up 30% to $0.27 per share, but still off its 52-week high of $0.35 per share. In the past week of trading, its volume has risen to an average of 41,000 shares traded daily. I like the aggressiveness of Sunwin, and its timing appears to be spot on, especially with Canada's announcement last week. Given the continued expansion of stevia globally, Sunwin may well be one of those small companies that may benefit shareholders with impressive stock gains if its success continues.</p><p><strong>Stevia First Corp. (<span>STVF.OB</span>),</strong> an early-stage agribusiness based in Yuba City, CA, may be poised to benefit heavily from growth of worldwide stevia use even though it has not sold any product as of yet. Stevia First's goal is to develop high-quality stevia at a highly competitive price. It is developing its stevia product using two completely separate methods designed for two completely different customer bases. The first is an industrial-size organic stevia farm in the U.S. This can be very lucrative considering that in 2010 organic food and beverage <a href=""http://www.organicnewsroom.com/2012/04/us_consumerdriven_organic_mark.html"">sales</a> were at $26.7 billion, and in 2011 these sales grew to $29.9 billion. And as of now there is only one organic stevia farm for the industry, and that's in China. Stevia First's other method of producing high-grade steviol glycosides is through a yeast <a href=""http://www.steviafirst.com/news/news_releases/2012/08/stevia-first-corp.-licenses-fermentation-based-stevia-intellectual-property-from-vineland-research-and-innovation-centre"">fermentation</a>-based process it licensed from Canada's Vineland Research and Innovation Centre. Even though stevia can be up to 300 times sweeter than sugar, there is actually very little of the sweet components in the stevia plant. The necessary extraction and purification of the stevia account for about 70% of the production costs. The controlled fermentation process makes it possible to convert low-cost plant materials into sweet steviol glycosides, and the process could bypass or significantly diminish the need for stevia leaf production altogether. This process has great potential for the company because, once operational, the fermentation process can ensure a consistent supply of stevia that is not dependent on weather or soil conditions. It can also produce a consistent tasting stevia from batch to batch, plus the process may have the ability to develop new characteristics in the strains of the Reb A that would be sweeter while weeding out the less desirable characteristics, such as bitterness or the lingering aftertaste. This fermentation method, once operational on an industrial scale, should afford Stevia First to bring its stevia to market at a much lower price than farm-grown stevia. That alone should interest manufacturers and producers <span>that </span>could then manufacture their own stevia-based products at a lower cost.</p><p>The question is, with stevia being a hot commodity, why isn't Stevia First rushing its production to get a crop in the ground and take advantage of the growing interest in stevia? The answer can be found in an earlier interview with Stevia First's <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/883621-interview-with-stevia-first-ceo-robert-brooke"">CEO Robert Brooke</a>: &quot;<em>Our goals are not geared towards short-term crop production, but towards building a sustainable stevia industry in the U.S. We are working to create the plant and practices desirable for farm-based stevia production, and also speed the emergence of fermentation-based production methods, since we see large markets for products derived from each.</em>&quot; Mr. Brooke went on to explain: &quot;<em>So rather than focusing on small-scale commercial stevia leaf production to make a few bucks in the short-term, our efforts are directed towards building sustainable competitive advantages that will enable us to compete favorably in the long-term with overseas stevia growers and producers.</em>&quot;</p><p>Stevia First has a market cap of $21.27 million, and its shares trade just below $0.40. The stock has been stagnant lately due to the lack of news coming from the company. However, Mr. Brooke did present an overview of Stevia First's growth strategy at the 5th annual LD MICRO conference on December 5th in Los Angeles. So hopefully there will be some news soon about how the company is advancing. What I find interesting about Stevia First is not that it plans on being a vertically integrated stevia company, but the two methods it plans on developing the actual stevia. The reason I look favorably on its methods of developing stevia is because, even if the company ends up not being a vertically-integrated company and just focuses on producing stevia and selling its product to companies <span>like</span> <strong>PureCircle, </strong><strong>Cargill</strong> or <strong>Kraft (<span>KRFT</span>), that</strong> alone should could make Stevia First a successful company. However, if its fermentation process becomes successful, I think stevia First could be primed for a buyout by one of the larger manufacturers<strong>.</strong> For those two reasons alone, I see that stevia First has a lot of potential for growth with the expanding stevia market, and this stock is worth a look at.</p><p>With Canada's approval for the use of stevia in food and beverage products, and the outlook of other countries soon approving the use of stevia, there are a number of companies that should benefit from the growth in stevia, including the latter three discussed above. I think Monster will continue to grow and could be a candidate for a takeover bid in the <span>future</span>. I also think it is the least risky of the companies mentioned. However, I think Stevia First has the potential to be biggest mover percentage-wise if, or when, it gets its production off the ground. But, caution is advised: Microcap stocks can be <span>volatile</span> - they offer huge upside potential and corresponding downside risks. These three companies offer good current-level entries for various levels of risk. Interested investors are advised to perform additional research to ascertain which, if any, of these fit their investment criteria.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

"1281721","2013-03-18 03:46:20","3 Companies Developing Novel Cancer Drug Delivery Platforms","<p>Developing novel drugs that extend the lives of cancer patients is only one step in the fight against the disease that takes the lives of <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/features/worldcancerday/"">7.6 million</a> people each year. The ability to deliver the drugs into the targeted cancer cells with the proper dosage while mitigating damage or side effects to other tissues can be just as important. Unfortunately, delivering the proper medicine efficiently, with the proper dosage, to the targeted area is no simple task. Below are three companies, of various sizes, that are developing targeted delivery platforms to deliver the much needed cancer drugs. And if proven successful and reliable, these delivery platforms will greatly benefit patients&hellip; and investors.</p><p><strong>Delivering Micro-Doses of Drugs To A Single Cancer Tumor</strong><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Celgene Company (CELG)</strong> is a large global biopharmaceutical company engaged in developing and commercializing cancer therapies and immune-inflammatory related diseases. Last week, the company announced it has entered into a <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/100522001/Presage_Biosciences_Announces_Strategic_Research_Alliance_with_Celgene_Corporation"">strategic collaboration</a> agreement with the much smaller, privately held biopharmaceutical company, Presage Biosciences, for Presage's proprietary technology platform to identify novel drug combinations for solid tumor indications. Presage's patented drug array platform is the only technology that allows for simultaneously analyzing multiple cancer drug candidates and drug combinations within a single living tumor. The platform enables the precise placement of multiple micro-dose treatments through the skin and directly into a tumor, which enables drug-specific responses to be measured within an array of multiple drugs. The micro-doses are then studied three-dimensionally, providing the ability to analyze the various drug effects across the span of a living tumor while capturing the heterogeneity of cancer cells to precisely gauge their effect. The end result is a personalized treatment that caters to the specific characteristics of a tumor and allows for faster results leading to the most effective treatment regimen.</p><p>According to Celgene's President of Research and Early Development, Thomas Daniel, M.D., in regards to what makes this drug platform different:</p><blockquote class=""quote""><p>Drug development is currently challenged by heavy reliance on in vitro test systems and animal xenografts of little relevance to individual patients. The Presage platform addresses this challenge, permitting rapid assessment of drug candidates and combinations in relevant models, with potential to base critical drug development decisions on in vivo response data. </p></blockquote><p>Celgene has committed <a href=""http://www.fiercedrugdelivery.com/story/celgene-drops-13m-presages-3-d-drug-delivery-platform/2013-03-08"">$5 million</a> of the $13 million overall investment to research funding and $8 million in equity, which will allow the smaller Presage Biosciences to grow. Twenty- one <a href=""http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/celgene-buys-upstarts-new-approach-evaluating-cancer-drugs/2013-03-05"">Presage workers</a> will be measuring tumor responses for drug combinations in mice and dogs, which will help guide Celgene in the selection of programs for the clinic.</p><p>This platform has the potential to be another blockbuster in Celgene's vast and impressive pipeline of cancer-fighting drugs, which includes the recently U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm338895.htm"">approved</a>, immunomodulatory drug, Pomalyst. <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-11/celgene-s-pomalidomide-helps-in-myeloma-after-others-fail.html"">Bloomberg</a> expects annual sales of Pomalyst, a drug designed to bolster the body's immune system to destroy cancerous cells and inhibit cancer cell growth in <a href=""http://myeloma.org/ArticlePage.action?articleId=1560"">multiple myeloma</a>, could reach $1 billion by 2017. Pomalyst is prescribed when Celgene's own flagship drug, Revlimid, which accounts for almost 66% of the company's sales, or Takeda Pharmaceuticals' drug, Velcade, have failed. In 2012, sales of Revlimid reached approximately $4.2 billion.</p><p>CELG, which has a market capitalization of $47.92 billion, has seen its stock rise 45% YTD closing on Thursday, March 14th at $114.28 per share. The company is expected to grow 20% compounded per year, and revenues to climb to <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-true-effect-positive-findings-research-report-on-celgene-corporation-and-gilead-sciences-inc-2013-01-23"">$12 billion</a> yearly over the next five years. On Monday, March 11th Bank of America reiterated its <a href=""http://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/13/03/3404284/update-bank-of-america-raises-pt-on-celgene-corporation-"">buy rating</a> and upped its target price from $113 per share to $127 per share following results of a commissioned statistical analysis Bank of America completed for an ongoing Revlimid study analyzing that there remains an additional 15-20% potential upside to the shares even after the recent run up. CELG has a strong pipeline of drugs on the market and in various stages of development. The company seems to be firing on all cylinders, and should continue to do so in the foreseeable future making the Celgene stock a strong one to own.</p><p><strong>Nanoknife - Irreversible Electroporation to Zap Cancer</strong><strong><br></strong></p><p>The second company that has a novel platform to battle cancer when surgery is not an option is <strong>AngioDynamics (ANGO)</strong>. Even though surgery is considered the best option for cancer patients, some tumors are inoperable because they sit next to major organs. In those cases, the option has been chemotherapy. But it has been found that chemotherapy works best when much of the tumor is already removed. Enter ANGO's <a href=""http://www.angiodynamics.com/products/nanoknife"">NanoKnife</a>, a minimally invasive targeted cancer treatment that utilizes irreversible electroporation to kill hard-to-reach tumors and tumor cells in areas that are too dangerous for conventional surgery. The NanoKnife consists of two needles (electrodes), roughly one to two millimeters in diameter, that are guided, via an ultrasound or CT scan, through the skin to the tumor site. Then quick bursts of 3000 volts of electric current zap the tumor, which perforate the tumor cells' membranes killing the cancer cells while leaving normal surrounding tissue viable and untouched. With the cell membranes permanently perforated, chemotherapeutic agents can also be administered to enter the cells and act more effectively on the opened cancer cells. The NanoKnife can be used for both primary tumors or for tumors that have <a href=""http://www.inova.org/cancer/conditions-treatments/nanoknife-overview"">metastasized</a> or spread to other parts or organs of the body in the liver, lungs, kidneys, and pancreas.</p><p>Though NanoKnife is approved by the FDA for surgical ablation of soft-tissue, concerns have been raised that the company has taken shortcuts in what is generally a long FDA approval process. The reason the company was able to get the <a href=""http://webprostatitis.org/tag/nanoknife/"">NanoKnife s approval</a> without conducting any randomized controlled clinical trials is due to a modification in the law enacted by congress in 1976, that allows for granting regulatory approval to certain medical devices quickly, often with little or no clinical evidence, if the device is similar enough to another already on the market. Therefore, the NanoKnife went from being tested on animals to being approved by the FDA as a cancer fighter. Though the lack of clinical tests, which may account for the less than warm reception and lower than expected sales, does not mean that the NanoKnife is not an effective platform in delivering its cancer treatment. According to a 2011 <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2124221/3-000-volt-jab-shrunk-inoperable-cancer-half.html"">Australian study</a> published in the Journal Of Vascular Interventional Radiology, the device has shown positive results: The treatment completely destroyed 83% of primary liver tumors.</p><p>ANGO has a market capitalization of $388.5 million. The company manufactures and sells surgical and diagnostic devices for vascular access, the treatment of peripheral vascular disease, and for oncology and surgical settings. The Company's devices are used in minimally invasive, image-guided procedures. The stock has maintained a narrow 52-week trading range, trading from a low of $10 to a high of $12.93. On March 8th ANGO's stock dropped over 10% after the company announced lower-than-expected 3rd quarter 2013 net <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/ANGO.O/key-developments/article/2708839"">earnings</a> estimated to total approximately $82 million, $7 million below earlier estimates of $89 million. The stock has since bounced back to close on Thursday, March 14th at $11.55 per share. According to President and CEO, <a href=""http://www.dailygazette.com/weblogs/your-business/2013/mar/12/0311_angio/"">Joseph DeVivo</a>:</p><blockquote class=""quote""><p>We're viewing the third quarter top line performance as a temporary setback. It is simply taking us more time to build momentum as we continue to onboard new technologies while our sales force settles in. However, we remain as confident as ever in our strategy for growth, our business model and in the management team we have in place.</p></blockquote><p>Part of Mr. DeVivo's strategy is to have a &quot;<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1267791-angiodynamics-ceo-presents-at-barclays-global-healthcare-conference-transcript?page=2%26p=qanda%26l=last"">big push</a>&quot; to grow internationally, which makes sense considering that today's business is global, and that 85% of the company's revenue still comes from sales in the United States. This is a good little company, and it will take time, patience, and positive results for the NanoKnife to gain more acceptance as an actual treatment for certain cancers; but if ANGO can grow its sales internationally the stock should grow too, though probably a little slower than the market wishes.</p><p><strong>OMS Platform - Reversible Electroporation To Zap Cancer<br></strong></p><p><strong>OncoSec Medical Inc. (ONCS.OB)</strong>, with a market capitalization of $18.21 million, is the smallest of the three companies profiled, but has what might be a big drug delivery platform with its propriety OncoSec Medical System [OMS], which is a reversible electroporation platform that the company uses to treat melanoma and other skin cancers. The difference between irreversible and reversible electroporation is that, with reversible electroporation, after the electric pulse is removed the pores of the affected cells close back up, trapping a chemotherapeutic or DNA-based drug inside the cell.</p><p>The OMS platform has a duel-purpose treatment design, dubbed ImmunoPulse and NeoPulse, depending on the therapy being administered. The company appears to now be focusing most of its efforts on its <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-technologies/immunopulse/"">ImmunoPulse</a>, which is currently in three <a href=""http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/vgxi-to-manufacture-gmp-il-12-plasmid-for-oncosec-s-electroimmunotherapy-trials/81246853/"">Phase II trials</a> for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. ImmunoPulse utilizes the DNA plasmid interleukin-12 (IL-12), which is injected directly to the tumor site. After the injection, six needle-like electrodes hooked up to a generator are inserted into the skin around the tumor. Short pulses of <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Melanoma-treatment-shows-promise-at-UCSF-3714590.php"">1,300 volts</a> are then administered, and the electric field causes the pores of the cancer cells' membranes to open, allowing the DNA plasmid to enter directly into the open pores. The electric field is then turned off and the cell pores close, trapping the cancer-killing DNA therapy inside the tumor cells allowing for a more effective treatment, while eliminating damage to healthy body systems.</p><p>Interestingly, the reversible electroporation has shown to affect a much larger area than just the targeted cells. Researchers have found that the patients' immune systems were attacking cancer cells outside the direct treatment areas, including distant lesions. Interim results of the ImmunoPulse Phase II trial for metastatic melanoma has supported the key findings from the previous Phase I trial, which indicated that ImmunoPulse is able to induce regression or stabilization of local and distant untreated metastases following a single cycle of treatment.</p><p>The other reversible electroporation-based therapy that ONCS is developing is NeoPulse, which uses the chemotherapeutic-based drug, bleomycin, a highly effective yet highly toxic anti-cancer drug. With NeoPulse, using the OMS system to directly target the cancerous cells, an <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/oncosec-technologies/neopulse/"">effective result</a> was achieved with 1/20th of a traditional dose of bleomycin; and by opening the cell membrane and trapping in the drug, it was shown that bleomycin had its ability to kill tumor cells enhanced by a factor of as much as 4,000. NeoPulse is in Phase II trials in the U.S. for skin cancer. The company's president and CEO, <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/896721-interview-with-oncosec-ceo-punit-dhillon"">Punit Dhillon</a>, said in an interview late last year that, since the company has only so many resources, he was looking for a partner as a licensing opportunity for NeoPulse. If that occurs it becomes a win-win for ONCS as it will gain a considerable amount of cash and it would allow ONCS to concentrate the company's efforts on continuing to develop ImmunoPulse.</p><p>ONCS stock closed on Thursday, March 14th at $0.206 per share. Mr. Dhillon will present at the <a href=""http://www.heraldonline.com/2013/03/14/4692261/oncosec-medical-to-present-at.html"">25th Annual Roth Conference</a> on Tuesday, March 19th and will provide an overview of the company and its milestones during the presentation. With the OMS system showing positive results in the clinical trials, ONCS appears closer to moving ahead to the next stage. This little company has the potential to make a big impact on the way certain cancer drugs are delivered to targeted cancer tumors, and this is a stock that could move significantly upward this year.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The three companies profiled are of various sizes, and while CELG is by far the safest of the three as an investment, ANGO and ONCS appear to have the potential for a larger percentage gain. They also, as much smaller companies, have a higher investment risk. It is advised to research any small, yet emerging, drug-medical device companies before investing.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[ONCS.OB]].

"1098041","2013-01-07 10:17:34","3 Investments In Stevia/Sugar Blends To Mix In With Your Portfolio","<p>There is little doubt that stevia continues to grow in favor as more people become aware of its many uses, and more countries around the globe continue to approve the sweet extract for both food and beverage products. The most recent country to approve stevia's use was Canada, giving its <a href=""http://www.diabetes.ca/diabetes-and-you/what/prevalence/"">9 million</a> diabetics the ability to enjoy the much needed natural zero calorie sugar substitute. Interestingly though, the trend for stevia's future success seems to be more in stevia/sugar blends, which <a href=""http://webdev.foodproductdesign.com/news/2012/09/new-stevia-sweetener-cuts-sugar-levels-by-50.aspx"">reduces the caloric counts</a> to levels up to 50% without losing the sweet sugary flavor that the consumers demand. Many of the sugar companies now have sugar/stevia blends on market shelves, like Domino's sugar blend <em>Domino Light</em>, or Cargill's <em>Truvia</em> baking blend; and many manufacturers now have products containing stevia/sugar blends on grocers' shelves, like PepsiCo's (PEP) <em>Trop 50</em>. Below are three companies that are adding stevia to their product lines or developing a better stevia product for the marketplace; and all three companies, along with respective investors, may find themselves benefiting from stevia in the future.</p><p><strong>Unilever N.V. (UN) and Unilever PLC. (UL)</strong> combine to make up the giant consumer goods company based in the Netherlands and London. Unilever has extended its product line by adding stevia and stevia sugar blends to many of its beverage products as the company takes a serious approach to lowering the calorie content in its ready-to-drink beverages such as its Lipton brand teas. The company states that even though it has already <a href=""http://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/nutrition-health/making-our-products-healthier/reducing-sugar-and-calories/"">reduced sugar</a> levels in the teas, its goal is to continue to gradually lower the sugar levels by an additional 25% by the year 2020. It plans to achieve this by blending in zero calorie sugar substitutes, artificial sweeteners like aspartame, and natural sweeteners like stevia, while reducing, but not eliminating, the sugar. Unilever already uses a sugar/stevia blend in four of its low calorie varieties of <a href=""http://www.pepsicobeveragefacts.com/print_infobycategory.php?pc=prod_catg.1067%26i=fsheet%26t=1026%26s=8%26oid=%26d=DESC"">100% Natural Lipton</a> iced teas, and has launched a sugar/stevia blend for its version of Lipton iced tea in Australia with 30% less sugar-and in Chile it launched its <em>Feel Green</em> iced tea also with 30% less sugar. Unilever continues to adjust its sugar levels in other products by using a sugar/stevia blend which now can now be found in its <a href=""http://www.knorr.ch/de/CH/Produktwelt/Produktdetails/KNORR-Tomaten-Ketchup-mit-Stevia/4ac90b76-b59b-4ef8-8eda-67fc52b2f040"">Knorr</a>, <a href=""http://www.marketingweek.gr/default.asp?pid=9&amp;la=1&amp;arId=42476"">Hellman's</a>, and <a href=""http://oursaviorsalbany.org/the-market-for-stevia-off-in-france/"">Amora</a> lines in Europe, which feature a sugar/stevia blend ketchup touting 40% less sugar (though Hellman's version boasts 50% less sugar).</p><p>Unilever N.V. has a market cap of $109 billion and Unilever PLC has a $110 billion market cap. Though both companies have separate identities and separate ticker symbols, both companies act as <a href=""http://www.unilever.com/investorrelations/shareholder_info/understanding_nvplc_shares/index.aspx"">one entity</a> with mutual sharing of brands, technology, and equal dividends. The companies share in some of the most recognizable brands on shelves around the world. Each day roughly 2 billion people use one of Unilever's brands including Lipton teas, Dove soaps, Axe, Vaseline, Ben &amp; Jerry's, Hellman's, and Knorr just to name a few. For the first six months of the year, the stocks seemed to be in the doldrums, hitting their 52-week lows of less than $31. However, in August the stocks began to strengthen, partly due to the Unilever North American sale of its <a href=""http://www.foodandbeveragepackaging.com/articles/85841-265-million-deal-for-conagra-and-unilever"">P.F. Chang s Home Menu</a> and Bertolli frozen meals in a deal worth $265 million, and the <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/UL/key-developments/article/2557510"">reorganizing</a> of its United Kingdom activities. Unilever stocks have also been helped by its strong presence in the <a href=""http://news.silobreaker.com/unilever-ceo-very-pleased-with-emerging-market-growth-5_2265860884851065027"">emerging markets</a>, which are growing at a rate of 11.4%. In mid-December <a href=""http://zolmax.com/credit-suisse-upgrades-unilever-nlg-1-12-adr-to-neutral-un/2929675/"">Credit Suisse</a> upgraded shares of Unilever from an underperform to a neutral, while analysts at Zacks, in a research note to investors on October 30th 2012, reiterated a neutral rating on shares with a $38.00 price target. Separately <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/100303638/RESEARCH_ALERTUnilever_UBS_raises_price_target"">UBS</a> issued a buy rating and raised its target price from &euro;30.00 to &euro;32.00, or $42.23 per share. Unilever announced a quarterly interim <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/UL/key-developments/article/2629122"">dividend for Q3 2012</a> at $0.32 per share, payable to shareholders registered at close of business on November 9, 2012. It pleases me that Unilever has added stevia to its product line, and I think that it can only enhance its customer base. I look at the stock to have potential to move upward-not significantly, but enough to make it worth a long term hold.</p><p><strong>SodaStream International Ltd (SODA)</strong>, based out of Israel, develops, manufactures, and markets its home beverage carbonation systems that allow consumers to instantly convert tap water into carbonated soft drinks and sparkling waters. For a small company that went public in November of 2010, its product appears to be catching on with the global consumer as it has posted <a href=""http://news.investors.com/investing-markets-update/122412-638173-herbalife-stock-loses-more-ground.htm"">double-digit sales</a> gains for 13 straight quarters. The company is selling more than <a href=""http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/losing_their_fizz_GPChL5sn9lNOf0TukJ1wAP"">10,000 soda machines a day</a> and can be found in more than 60,000 stores in 45 countries, and appears to be growing as the company plans expansion in 2013 into India, Mexico, China, and Greece. There are solid reasons for the <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/calebmelby/2012/07/19/sodastreams-moneymaking-battle-cry-get-rid-of-plastic-bottles/"">success</a> of SodaStream, and the most important is the cost. The consumer can save a lot of money by using SodaStream: The exchangeable carbon dioxide canisters cost $15.00 and make the equivalent of 170- 12oz cans of soda; add in the syrup and the total cost is about $0.25 per glass. Another reason for the success of SodaStream is that the syrups have 66% less sugar, sodium, and calories than a typical carbonated beverage, and there's little waste since the bottles are reusable. In March 2012 SodaStream introduced 12 new lower calorie syrup flavors including pink grapefruit, peach-pear, orange, lemon-lime, cranberry-apple, all sweetened with stevia. According to <a href=""http://www.sodastream.com/node/510"">Daniel Birnbaum</a>, SodaStream's CEO, <em>&quot;Diet flavors sweetened naturally with stevia are another key milestone in our commitment to provide healthier alternatives to pre-packaged carbonated drinks. Consumers can now make a smarter beverage choice, not only for the environment and their wallet, but also for the wellness of their family. We remain committed to continue empowering consumers with better, more innovative products.&quot;</em></p><p>SodaStream, with a market cap of $878.41 million, has had an excellent run-up of 33% YTD. In February the stock hit a high of $48.13 shortly after announcing its partnership with <a href=""http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/79226/kraft-foods-expands-sodastream-deal"">Kraft Foods</a> <strong>(KRFT)</strong> to add Crystal Light and Country Time Lemonade to its SodaStream line; and in July it announced the addition of Kraft's Kool-Aid brand as well. In November the company announced it entered into a <a href=""http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20121112005864/en/Campbell-Soup-Company-SodaStream-Offer-V8-Splash"">licensing agreement</a> with the <strong>Campbell Soup Company (CPB)</strong> to add V8 Splash and V8 V-Fusion brands for the SodaStream line. According to I/B/E/S Estimates, analysts are expecting the company to report revenue of $415 million and net income of $48 million for fiscal 2012, an increase of roughly 46% over 2011, which saw <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/SODA.O/key-developments/article/2638591"">revenue</a> of $289.0 million. Currently <a href=""http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/86892/another-earnings-beat-for-sodastream"">Zacks</a> has a neutral rating on SodaStream, but it added that the company has bright prospects going forward: <em>&quot;Solid demand, expanding strategic partnerships like with Kraft Foods Group, Inc., enhanced marketing activities, regular product innovations, accretive acquisitions and successful strategic investments will drive the stock going forward.&quot;</em> Zacks also added that the analysts could not rule out an upgrade in the near term. I agree with Zacks assessment and I see SodaStream as more than a novelty or fad that will eventually end up buried in the cupboard. I think SodaStream, like its new stevia based syrups, is here to stay and I think the stock has good potential to continue to grow.</p><p><strong>STEVIA FIRST CORP (STVF.OB)</strong>, a small development-phase agricultural biotechnology company out of Yuba City, California, is one of the few companies that plans to actually grow stevia in the U.S. However, the company appears to be taking a more calculated approach in developing its business. Today's stevia plants, though far superior than strains just a few years ago, are still in early stages of development, and growers and producers are working diligently to create better tasting and more consistent plants while still rushing its product to market to meet market demands. Stevia First has a different approach as the company appears to have realized that the demand for stevia will continue to grow globally. Even though it could plant stevia today on an industrial scale on its leased 1000 acres in California's central valley, the company believes that the best business approach is to develop a product that is superior to other stevia products on the market, which will then result in a future competitive edge. Interestingly, not only does Stevia First plan to develop a superior product, it just may be able to do so at a much lower cost than its competitors. The stevia leaves themself actually contain a small amount of the sweet steviol glycosides, and 70% of the leaf production costs are eaten up in growing the plant, then removing and purifying the steviol glycosides to make the sweet rebaudioside A extract. To address this, Stevia First has licensed a <a href=""http://www.steviafirst.com/news/news_releases/2012/08/stevia-first-corp.-licenses-fermentation-based-stevia-intellectual-property-from-vineland-research-and-innovation-centre"">fermentation process</a> from Vineland Research and Innovation Centre of Ontario, Canada that would eliminate such costly leaf production. The process will dramatically cut the costs of the production and purifying process and will spell a major competitive edge if proven so. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada scientists working with Vineland Research were able to map the biochemical pathways of the steviol glycosides, which gave them the knowledge of the characteristics of these pathways enabling them to modify the steviol glycosides and have a controlled end product. Doing this, they were able to convert low-cost plant materials into sweet steviol glycosides, diminishing or perhaps bypassing the need for growing the entire stevia plant. Thus, if Stevia First is correct it will be able to produce a super high- grade stevia that would be consistent from batch to batch, and at a much lower cost than its competitors.</p><p>Stevia First Corp is a nano-cap early stage development-phase company with a market cap of $17.23 million, and at this time it has no sales or earnings; and its stock, as with most developmental companies, moves in high percentages up or down depending on news or lack of news. What it has that may set it apart from other small developing companies is a promising fermentation technology focused one of the hottest commodities on the market today, stevia. If Stevia First can develop the fermentation process on an industrial scale there is a good chance that this company will have a solid chance of successfully bringing its product to market, and perhaps become one of the leaders in stevia production and sales. And if that begins to happen, I would expect one of the larger producers or food manufacturers to look at Stevia First as a possible acquisition. Stevia First closed on Wednesday, January 2nd at $0.345 per share. It has seen its stock skyrocket to $3.28 per share early in 2012 on positive news, only to find it come back down to earth. I think that Stevia First Corp's stock has, at this time, a good entry price, and I look for the company to grow and the stock to rise in 2013.</p><p>Stevia continues to grow, and with good reason. 10% of the world's population is now <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/22/obesity-rates-rising-developed-fattest-world_n_1294212.html"">obese</a>, and 350 million people suffer from <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304231204576405783420390772.html"">diabetes</a>. I think that as more people recognize how cutting down on sugars will lower their risk of becoming obese or diabetic, and that stevia can play a major role in lowering their sugar consumption, companies like Unilever, Soda Stream, and Stevia First can find their profits climbing as the people switch to consuming healthier and less sugar-laced products. I think the sugar/stevia blend is the perfect mix for both consumers and investors to see their health and profits rise. The companies offered here appear to have good current-level entries for various levels of risk. But I caution: Nano-cap stocks, like Stevia First, can be volatile. They offer huge upside potential and corresponding downside risks. Interested investors are advised to perform additional research to determine which, if any, of these fit their long-term goals.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[STVF.OB]].

"931391","2012-10-18 04:13:28","5 Big Time Biotech Movers On Wednesday","<p>On Wednesday, as the market traded mostly flat, there were several biotechnology stocks that broke into a new range with heavy trading volume and/or key developments. These companies were of different sizes and of different platforms in terms of clinical development. In fact, the only real similarity between these companies is that each moved on Wednesday. Therefore, I am taking a look at these five stocks, and trying to determine if any are worth considering for long-term investment.</p><p><strong>Arena Pharmaceuticals (ARNA)</strong> took off and traded higher by yet another 5% on Wednesday, adding to its now 14% gain since October 8. Shares of the biotech stocks have traded higher for a couple reasons: First, it <a href=""http://www.sacbee.com/2012/10/12/4905652/arena-pharmaceuticals-initiates.html"" target=""_blank"">initiated</a> a Phase 1 trial for APD811 for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, thus strengthening its pipeline. Second, investors are optimistic thanks to better-than-expected initial sales of VIVUS' (VVUS) weight loss drug, which is already available to patients via a mail-order program. Some investors believe that, due to the marketing benefits of Arena's drug, Belviq, VIVUS' success could be an indication of what's to come for Arena's weight loss product. With the stock trading at $9.85, it's still priced more than 30% off its 2012 high, following the announcement of its approval. With ARNA now trading higher, it is possible that its rally could last and continue with even larger gains.</p><p>Clinical phase company, <strong>InterMune (ITMN),</strong> traded higher by nearly 10% with heavy volume on what looks like a technical rally. The stock had traded with a 10% loss over the last month, continuing its loss even after its product, Esbriet, was <a href=""http://www.rttnews.com/1976180/intermune-inc-itmn-is-up-after-canadian-approval-of-esbriet.aspx?utm_source=google%26utm_campaign=sitemap"" target=""_blank"">approved</a> in Canada earlier this month for the treatment of mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in adults. It can be implied that its gains on Wednesday may be a reverse after the stock was oversold. However, there was news that Deerfield Management increased its stake in the company, by a significant margin, which may have also contributed to the rally. ITMN is an extremely oversold stock, having lost more than 60% of its value during the last year alone. With that in mind, I am not sure that its 10% gain is an indication of a change in the direction of the stock. With no other significant news I can ascertain, I believe it's a technical rally, which I try to avoid chasing.</p><p><strong>Galena Biopharma (GALE)</strong> rallied 6.5% on Wednesday on what also appears to be a technical rally. The stock had traded with a lot of volatility over the last two months, between a range of $1.80 and $2.00, but on Wednesday broke through this range on heavy volume, and traded considerably higher. This marks the first time since the end of Q1 that GALE has traded over $2.05, and has done so with much less volume. Back in Q1, GALE was trading with volume of 5, 10, 20, and even 30 million shares trading hands per day. Shortly thereafter, it fell pretty hard in Q2 to a low of $1.10 after reaching highs over $3.00. The stock has since recovered, slowly but surely, at a much more moderate pace, and almost under-the-radar. My opinion is that investors are preparing for final data from its Phase 2 trial of NeuVax for breast cancer in Q4, and that the rally makes sense considering the upside of the company. At its current price, the company is valued at $140 million. Galena is a Phase 3 company with a product that was successful in Phase 2 trials, and could enter a massive market to prevent the recurrence of breast cancer, if successful in its ongoing Phase 3 trial. With that said, I am not surprised at its rally; I anticipate a slow and steady rally over the next year, as the company's valuation reflects the company's potential with its product, NeuVax.</p><p><strong>Peregrine Pharmaceuticals (PPHM)</strong> traded higher by more than 20% after the company provided an update on <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/peregrine-pharmaceuticals-provides-corporate-activities-120000707.html"" target=""_blank"">corporate activities</a>. Peregrine announced that it replaced its prior loan facility with over $14 million in financing proceeds that were received since the end of September, and that it continues to grow its manufacturing business. The reason this provoked such a large gain is due to the previous rumors that the company would have trouble in finishing clinical studies after defaulting on nearly $16 million. Consequently, some found this news on Wednesday encouraging, or as a sign that its financials aren't as suspect as previously thought. Though keep in mind, this is a company that has lost more than 80% of its value in less than a month. The company's announcement of ""major discrepancies"" has appropriately been priced into the stock, and perhaps the news on Wednesday is the start of a new beginning for this company. In any case, considering all that's occurred I would personally wait. In my opinion, shares will be trading lower again soon and provide for lower entries for those wishing to open a position in this controversial biotech. There are just too many questions left to be answered.</p><p><strong>OncoSec Medical (ONCS.OB)</strong> has rallied 80% in the last month alone with a gain of 25% on Wednesday. The company had announced that it would be presenting preliminary data for its Phase 2 Merkel cell carcinoma trial on October 26 and that it would be presenting Phase 2 data on its metastatic melanoma trial on November 15. This is what led to most of its gains during the last month. However, on Wednesday the company <a href=""http://www.sacbee.com/2012/10/17/4917805/oncosec-receives-ce-mark-for-its.html"" target=""_blank"">announced</a> that it received authorization to CE mark its proprietary gene and drug delivery platform, OncoSec Medical System (OMS). This medical system is used for both the company's ImmunoPulse and NeoPulse systems, which is a form of immunotherapy and chemotherapy, respectively. The company's device uses electrical currents to create pores in the cells of cancer tumors as a form of targeted therapy. The company has been under-the-radar, but now appears to be trending higher, with data presentations expected to begin next week. I think it could be a promising stock to watch, as the market is obviously expecting good results-and judging by its earlier trials, the data could very well lead to larger gains. With the company's shares now trading at elevated levels, investors are advised to perform considerable due diligence to ascertain their own risk/reward for this budding biotech.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[GALE]], [[ONCS.OB]].

"986381","2012-11-07 10:40:45","NeoStem to Create Value with Billion Dollar Potential","<p>A couple weeks ago I wrote an article that was somewhat controversial when I voiced my beliefs that NeoStem (NBS) would reverse its stock. Since then many people have expressed their opinions regarding the reverse, and their belief that it would be a bad idea. After further consideration, and after reading a <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/977991-neostem-ceo-dr-smith-talks-pct-potential-and-explains-recent-bullish-developments"">recent interview with the CEO of the company,</a> Dr. Smith, it is evident that there will be no reverse split, that I was wrong, and the reason is related to the strategy, the goals, and the direction of this company.</p><p>The entire discussion of a possible reverse split was a result of a company filing in which an authorization for a reverse split was disclosed. However, in a recent interview the CEO <span>made </span>it very clear that no reverse split would occur at this time.</p><p>&quot;<em>As part of the ordinary course of business, NeoStem sought shareholder approval to execute a reverse split if such a transaction was in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.&quot;</em></p><p><em>&quot;In fact, we have sought this approval in previous years, however we have not executed on this transaction.&quot;</em></p><p><em>&quot;The main goal of this approval is adding flexibility to the capital structure and not necessarily to do a reverse split.&quot;</em></p><p><em>&quot;We have no plans to reverse the stock.&quot;</em></p><p>NeoStem has become a biotechnology company that is very focused on the health of its balance sheet. The company has more upside than at any period in its history due to several late stage candidates in its manufacturing business and two recent announcements of data for both VSELs and its lead product AMR-001. The statements above validate this notion along with the fact that NeoStem will not reverse its stock at any point in the near future.</p><p>The fact of the matter is that a reverse-split does not mean anything in terms of valuation to the company. It has no impact whatsoever. It simply decreases the number of shares and raises the price of the stock. My original argument was that it would benefit NeoStem due to institutional interest. However, with 152.54 million shares outstanding, the company is undeniably trading with the correct number of shares if it's to become a billion dollar company.</p><p>Investors, such as myself, will typically look through filings to find certain hints at upcoming developments, however Dr. Smith clearly points to the fact that this &quot;approval&quot; is nothing new, they had sought this approval in recent years, and have never executed. It simply gives the company the flexibility, as mentioned above. NeoStem does not have the same requirements as a stock listed on the NASDAQ because it trades on the NYSE: MKT, the need to reverse the stock is unnecessary, and could create uncertainty on behalf of investors.</p><p>After assessing all of the available information I now believe it makes more sense that the company does not reverse its stock. The data from AMR-001 has all been positive, according to a recent <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23065358"">publication</a>, and the company believes there is a market potential for the drug of more than $1 billion, analysts say more than $700 million annually. In the same interview, where Dr. Smith says there is no plan for a reverse split. With three late-stage candidates that all have $1 billion of market potential, the company could earn substantial revenue from the PCT segment. As a result, its current share count makes sense for the long-term direction of this company, a company that could easily create revenue in excess of $1 billion, within the next five years, as the company becomes a clear leader in cell therapy.</p><p>NeoStem is in a unique position to become the dominant company in cell therapy. It is much more advanced compared to other cell therapy companies such as Neuralstem (CUR) and StemCells (STEM). Both Neuralstem and StemCells have rallied in 2012 with the announcement of animal studies. However, NeoStem has announced its own encouraging animal study, also has a late stage product, and a manufacturing segment, which means its upside far exceeds the speculation of StemCells or Neuralstem. Osiris Therarpeutics (OSIR) is the only company in the space with an approved product that has a cell therapy as the main component. However, it trades with three and a half times the valuation of NeoStem and its approved product Prochymal has very little market upside with its one indication. In fact, the market potential for Prochymal is equal to or less than NeoStem's current manufacturing business. As a result, I believe NeoStem is the best choice as an investment in this space, both for its upside and the plan that management is executing.</p><p>Too often CEOs and executives of clinical phase biotechnology companies care too much about the performance of a stock. However, I think NeoStem has an executive staff in place that cares deeply about the long-term prospects of the company, and the decision of not executing a reverse-split is further proof.  With the company selling its generic pharmacy, improving its balance sheet (cash position), and redeeming its Series E Preferred stock, I think it's almost evident that NeoStem is planning for its future and is preparing to grow by a large margin over the next several years.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[NBS]].

"1067921","2012-12-17 08:37:09","Galena Pulls Back While Analysts Rush To Its Defense","<p>On Friday December 7th, shares of Galena Biopharma (GALE) traded higher by more than 10%, touching highs of $2.40 in premarket trading. The large pop was nothing new for the Phase 3 biotechnology company, as it continued to be one of the top performers of 2012. However, in what seemed like the blink of an eye, the stock began to fall, and has continued over a two-day period to a low of $1.85. Now, the stock has balanced, but the profit-taking itself has sparked a lot of confusion, as analysts continue to reiterate that key clinical data was positive yet investors remain uncertain of their next step.</p><p>The week of December 3rd was transformational for the biotechnology company. First it announced a <a href=""http://investors.galenabiopharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=724704"" target=""_blank"">deal with Teva Pharmaceuticals</a> (TEVA); then it announced a <a href=""http://pharmabiz.com/NewsDetails.aspx?aid=72602&amp;sid=2"" target=""_blank"">partnership with Leica Biosystems</a>; and finally it <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/galena-biopharma-presents-final-landmark-120500395.html"" target=""_blank"">presented superior clinical data</a> to anything else we've seen in the prevention of breast cancer recurrence. As a result of these developments, there were at least five firms that reiterated their outlook, initiated coverage, or simply presented their opinion on the price movement. With this in mind, let's take a look at what the analysts had to say about the developments.</p><p><b>Analyst Outlooks</b></p><p>December 4th-- <a href=""http://www.dailypolitical.com/finance/stock-market/dawson-james-starts-stock-coverage-on-galena-biopharma-gale.htm"" target=""_blank"">Dawson James reiterated its price target</a> of $3.00 with a ""Market Outperform"" rating following the company's partnership with Teva. The firm noted, ""GALE has secured an important portal of entry in Israel, with Teva assuming regulatory registration, local development and commercialization responsibilities in the region."" The firm also noted that it expects interim Phase 3 data during the second half of 2013, along with the initiation of a prostate cancer trial using NeuVax.</p><p>December 6th-- <a href=""http://www.thelifesciencesreport.com/pub/co/4518"" target=""_blank"">Roth Capital Partners reiterated their ""buy""</a> rating and $5.00 price target following the Teva deal and the Leica partnership. Leica's ""Bond Oracle HER2 IHC System"" will be used to screen patients who meet the criteria of Galena's PRESENT Phase 3 trial. The firm called the news ""another positive chess move"" and listed its upcoming catalysts including the belief that the Teva partnership is the first of many.</p><p><a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-12-07/galena-falls-on-latest-data-for-cancer-treatment"" target=""_blank"">MLV &amp; Co.</a> presented a very detailed case on December 6th following both the news of Teva and Leica partnerships, giving a price target of $6.00, a ""buy"" rating, and defending its position well. MLV noted the Leica deal as removing the potential for human error, allowing the two to work together in identifying patients with HER levels less than 2+ that might benefit from treatment. In addition, MLV discusses the Teva partnership, saying it signals a strategy of adding global commercial value and places Galena in a stronger negotiating position for future partnerships and/or acquisition discussions.</p><p>In a <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-12-07/galena-falls-on-latest-data-for-cancer-treatment"" target=""_blank"">Bloomberg interview</a> on December 7th, following the company's data and the stock's decline, MLV &amp; Co. analyst, Megan McCloskey, reminded investors that the data results were ""phenomenal"". Furthermore, Dawson James Securities analyst, Michael King, stated (in the same Bloomberg article) that ""NeuVax had an exceptionally favorable safety profile and an impressive reduction in the risk of disease recurrence"". The comments by both analysts show that, despite the stock's movement, it is not a reflection of data. In addition to taking part in a Bloomberg interview, Dawson James also <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-12-07/galena-falls-on-latest-data-for-cancer-treatment"" target=""_blank"">provided</a> a company update following Galena's announcement of data and its price movement on Friday.</p><p>Dawson James explained that final data included an exceptionally favorable safety profile and an impressive reduction in the risk of the disease. An important question for investors is whether the booster shots aid in preventing recurrence and, according to Dawson James, the booster shots were affective at improving the results. This is important because boosters will be used in the Phase 3 trial, while it was sparingly used in the Phase 2 trial. Also, Cantor reiterated its price target of $4.00 citing the benefits of the Teva partnership, including the elimination of costs and the progress of its clinical study. And finally, Zacks gave a bullish outlook in its assessment of the company's data, saying <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/galena-track-advance-neuvax-140000093.html"" target=""_blank"">Galena is on track to advance NeuVax</a>, and might be the best read of all the assessments of data.</p><p><b>Valuation and Bullish Price Targets</b></p><p>Galena Biopharma is currently trading with a market cap of $128 million, which represents a $32 million loss since the company announced data. Aside from the short-term volatility and its $1.90 price, most analysts are predicting a price anywhere between $3.00 and $6.00; but how does it get there?</p><p>If Galena was to reach the top target of $6.00, it would be valued over $400 million. Not bad for a company that began the year as a $35 million company. However, this is not an odd occurrence in this sector. There are countless companies, such as Inhibitex, Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT), and Pharmacyclics (PCYC), that all saw similar valuations and rose with even larger gains in a shorter period of time. Therefore, Galena's 2012 movement and its expected 2013 gains are not unheard of and are obviously sought among the investment community.</p><p>The company's large increase in value and its bullish targets have come in a similar fashion as the three referenced companies above; as we've received additional data and now better understand the product and its design in the Phase 3 study. In the Phase 2 study, NeuVax established statistical significance at 36 months (Phase 3's landmark data), demonstrated far superior results with node-positive patients (those being tested in Phase 3), and when combined with boosters at 60-months, it demonstrated a recurrence rate of just 5.6% compared to a 25.9% rate for the control group.</p><p>All together the data indicates a strong chance of success in its Phase 3 trial and a company worth far more than $128 million. In the large trial, all patients will be node-positive rather than a combination with node-negative, which occurred in the Phase 2 study. All patients will be optimally dosed and will have booster shots; meanwhile only a quarter of the patients were optimally dosed in Phase 2 studies. When taking these facts into consideration it's not hard to see how analysts could value the company at $400 million.</p><p>If the product is successful, Galena could return sales in the billions; with the key word being ""if"". In the second half of 2013 the company will announce interim results and, if successful, it is likely that Galena could be instantly valued to reflect potential sales. Thus, bullish analyst targets are based upon their belief that clinical results will be favorable. This in part is due to the difference of design compared to the Phase 2 study.</p><p>Galena has been able to take all of the strengths from its Phase 2 trial and then build a Phase 3 study around those strengths. As a result, analysts believe these changes, combined with optimally-dosed patients, will yield better results. If so, a $400 million market cap would be attainable. And if the company can in fact build on its recent Teva partnership, and add more partnerships (now that it has final phase 2 data), then the stock might just exceed even the most bullish of expectations.</p><p><b>Author's Take</b></p><p>So what does all of this mean? We have a stock that has traded lower, but one that analysts are also screaming is a ""buy"". Perhaps investors don't see the short-term upside, now that final data has been announced? However, as pointed out in a <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1056841-galena-biopharma-recent-developments-paint-a-picture-of-the-year-ahead"" target=""_blank"">recent Seeking Alpha article</a>, Galena can now focus on finding partnerships and other licensing agreements to become a more efficient and cost-effective company. I agree with the assessment, and the assessment of the analysts, who believe the Teva partnership was the first of many. And now with one partnership and unmatched clinical data, the company begins to look more attractive than at any point over the last year.</p><p>Regardless of how you assess Galena Biopharma, it is hard to deny the data. After a while, the outlooks and the statistics start to run together, becoming difficult to assess. Therefore, I think a good conclusion to Galena's last week and its future is that the Teva partnership will cut costs and should open new doors; the Leica agreement should allow for a more efficient selection process, and the data from its final analysis was very strong as the company continues to innovate and move forward. As a result, with its recent pullback, the company is presenting value, with little risk and a high reward.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[GALE]], [[SRPT]].

"493861","2012-04-12 10:11:08","Which Q1 Biotech Movers Can Build Off Momentum?","<p>The first quarter of 2012 has been one of satisfaction for the majority of investors, following a period of loss in the final 6 months of 2011. For some biotechnology stocks it has been particularly rewarding, as biotechnology once again has the most number of stocks with 100% returns in Q1. These stocks have performed with great gains, but now that we start Q2 some will be re-evaluating the performance and making changes to their portfolio. Therefore, I am looking at the ten biggest gains in biotechnology during the first quarter of 2012, and then identifying catalysts and the potential direction of each stock throughout the remainder of Q2.</p><p><strong>Threshold Pharmaceuticals (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/thld"">THLD</a>)</strong></p><p>Threshold Pharmaceuticals has been the best performing stock in the biotechnology space with a Q1 gain of 621%. The company is one of many in the cancer treating industry to trade with a significant amount of optimism to start 2012. The stock's gains have centered around several key developments related to its small molecule hypoxia-targeted drug, TH-302. The stock traded flat till February, until the company announced a global <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/THLD.O/key-developments/article/2474078"">agreement</a> with Merck KGaA (MKGAF.PK) to co-develop and commercialize TH-302, which instantly resulted in a 150% gain. Soon after, the company <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/threshold-pharmaceuticals-doses-first-patient-in-clinical-trial-evaluating-th-302-in-multiple-myeloma-2012-03-14?reflink=MW_news_stmp"">announced</a> that its Phase 2b study met its primary endpoint with a 63% improvement in progression-free survival. The strong clinical results have since encouraged a continuous rally, and, with the company now progressing with the study of its lead candidate, the stock has traded with authority.</p><p>With a 621% quarterly gain, some probably assume that profit taking will occur at some point in the near future. In the first four days of the second quarter the stock has lost 16% of its value, as the very volatile stock traded lower with the market. Whether or not the trend will continue is unknown, however, the company will most likely release various updates over the next few months regarding its current trial, which will be market-moving information. As an investor, I am most concerned with the questions surrounding the drug's safety, overall survival, and side effects. These questions must be answered to maintain its current level of optimism so that THLD can continue to trade higher, or at least hold its gains. As a person who has lost a loved one to pancreatic cancer, I am hoping for the success of both this company and its drug; and if THLD can continue to produce solid results, then there is no doubt it will trade higher, although an immediate pullback does appear possible. It's definitely a stock-to-watch because, with positive results from future data, the upside is quite large.</p><p><strong>Galena Biopharma (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/gale"">GALE</a>)</strong></p><p>Galena Biopharma began trading higher on January 5 when it <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/GALE.O/key-developments/article/2460137"">announced</a> the approval for a Phase II trial with the treatment of NeuVax and Herceptin. Almost immediately the stock began to trade higher as optimism surrounding the company's lead candidate, NeuVax, and was encouraged by several key <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/GALE.O/key-developments"">developments</a>, including a <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/448501-galena-biopharma-s-patent-creates-both-immediate-and-long-term-upside"">patent</a> on the drug and a dividend payment in the form of RXI shares. As a late stage candidate, NeuVax's potential has become an area of optimism, as a result of few treatments in breast cancer and NeuVax being the most advanced treatment under-development. As a result, the stock posted a Q1 gain of 373% due to it being significantly undervalued at the beginning of the year.</p><p>Much like THLD, GALE has performed with loss during the first few days of the Q2, a loss of 15%. However, the stock has several short-term catalysts for growth that could spark additional gains, especially considering its value-presenting price. The company will present 48-month data at the ASCO meeting regarding the long-term durability of NeuVax. This could help prove breast cancer to be a maintenance disease that includes boosters every six months, which would be good for patients and give GALE much stronger commercial opportunities. The company is also planning to have 100 clinical sites enrolled for its Phase III trial by mid-2012, which is important to investors. The NeuVax with Herceptin combination study is expected to start near the same time, and if successful could open several revenue producing doors. Overall, I believe the stock is undervalued considering potential, and believe there are enough short-term catalysts to result in a higher trend during the immediate future.</p><p><strong>Agenus Inc. (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/agen"">AGEN</a>)</strong></p><p>Agenus is a very volatile stock that has traded in wild swings over the last year. It lost 60% of its value during the last 6 months of 2011 as the market was trading lower, but has since recovered to post a gain of 230% in Q1. The stock's most recent gains have been led by an abundance of speculation that AGEN could potentially be purchased because of its corporate partnerships and the latest <a href=""http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/news.html?d=238477"">encouraging</a> data surrounding several of its late- stage candidates. The company does make a very enticing acquisition target with a therapy that is showing signs of being able to effectively treat several conditions. The company uses immunotherapy, which has been a therapy of choice for investors in 2012, with several immunotherapy stocks trading significantly higher.</p><p>The question for investors is whether or not AGEN has reached a limit or can continue to trade higher. I think AGEN's immediate trend is completely dependent upon the direction of the market. In November the company released strong data for its Phase II trials of G-200 but continued to trade lower until January, when the market reversed. The company is <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/319764-pharma-leaders-emerging-in-immunotherapy-approach-to-fighting-glioblastoma?source=yahoo"">expected</a> to provide several clinical updates at this year's ASCO meeting, in addition to its upcoming <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/agenus-brain-cancer-vaccine-phase-110000913.html"">presentation</a> for its glioblastoma vaccine in mid-April, which could move the stock further, assuming the market trades flat or slightly higher.</p><p><strong>BioDelivery Sciences International (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/bdsi"">BDSI</a>)</strong></p><p>BDSI is the final biotechnology stock to return over 200% in Q1. It has been a bumpy road for the company: back in September of 2011 the stock dropped from $3 to $1 after its Phase III efficiency study for chronic pain with the use of Buprenorphine <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/BDSI.O/key-developments/article/2406993"">produced</a> less than stellar results; but in 2012 the tide turned for BDSI after Endo Pharmaceuticals <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Endo-Pharma-signs-licensing-apf-1594129102.html?x=0"">agreed</a> to pay $180 million for licensing rights to market the pain treatment BEMA Buprenorphine. In addition to the deal with Endo, the company won its patent- related charges and reached an <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/BDSI.O/key-developments/article/2490267"">agreement</a> on BNX's developmental plan with the FDA.</p><p>In my opinion, BDSI is second to only GALE in having the most amount of upside from its current position. The company's candidate Buprenorphine/Naloxone with the BEMA technology has the potential for a massive market in revenue. Suboxone is quickly growing in revenue, and because of its high cost, the drug probably hasn't reached its potential, since it caters to a majority of low-income populations. BDSI has managed to bypass the patented technology of Suboxone with its own delivery technology, and then if you incorporate the potential of Buprenorphine to treat pain, but with lower dependency risk than other strong drugs, it seems as though BDSI could become a very large company with revenue in the billions. As an investor, it is encouraging that BDSI is using drugs that are already proven effective and that could be awarded an approval by simply altering the delivery of an already approved and successful drug. Therefore, I believe the stock still has upside potential, yet its immediate upside is limited to its number of short-term catalysts; and at this time it appears as though most of BDSI's catalysts are long-term.</p><p><strong>Alimera Sciences (<a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/alim"">ALIM</a>)</strong></p><p>Alimera Sciences has returned a YTD gain of 172% after trading with significant loss in the last 6 months of 2011. In November the stock went from $9 to $2 following a <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/ALIM.O/key-developments/article/2433148"">response letter</a> from the FDA after its second rejection of the company's eye drug Iluvien, citing risks that were not worth the reward. Yet in late February the stock recovered a portion of its loss after its eye drug Iluvien received an <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Alimera-Sciences-Announces-pz-2032277299.html?x=0"">approval</a> to treat diabetic macular edema (DME) in seven major European countries. As a result, the stock has traded relatively flat and has held its gains following the news of the approval.</p><p>I think ALIM has a good chance to hold its recent gains and possibly trade higher in Q2. The stock is still trading with a 56% one year loss, therefore I believe investors are willing to hold at this level due to the company now being awarded an approval. The European approvals include several benefits that give ALIM a variety of options. First, the company will return a significant amount of revenue from sales in the seven European countries; and because of future sales, and a $100 million valuation, the company is a very attractive acquisition target for large pharma. Most investors are hoping for the company to be purchased in the next few months, however I wouldn't be surprised to see a licensing deal rather than an acquisition. The European approvals do not mean that Iluvien will be awarded an FDA approval, but they can't hurt. ALIM was highly criticized during its last attempt for approval because of safety concerns; but if it succeeds in the European market, it could provide proof that the rewards outweigh the risks, and the company could put to rest any possible manufacturing concerns. However, it is also possible that its European experience will be a failure and result in further loss. Overall, I think it's a great value considering its possibilities. Investors are most likely to hold and see how the events unfold, which will allow the stock to maintain its price or possibly trade higher in Q2.</p><p>There is no doubt that it was an eventful quarter for several biotechnology companies and investors who owned the stocks. So far we have discussed the top 5 performers in this space. However, there are several additional stocks that have performed well. In fact, the biotechnology industry produced 35 companies that traded higher by more than 70% in Q1. Therefore, in Part II we will be looking at the remainder of the top 10 best performing biotechnology stocks; and this list will include several large and small companies that still present significant upside potential.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/gale"">GALE</a>.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The information in this article is not to be used to make any investment decisions.

"769341","2012-08-01 11:03:04","Radioisotopes: New Hope Using An Old Therapy","<p>Savvy investors in the pharmaceutical sector often spend a great deal of time researching the latest and most promising trial data and try to ascertain before the masses what the &quot;next big thing&quot; will be in disease treatment. Early entry into volatile and small cap pharma is desirable for traders more willing to tolerate high risk. Others prefer the safer, but often correspondingly lower returns via entries in the large pharmaceuticals with higher market capitalizations and stable revenue, but even these companies can provide for nice returns as patient and well-educated investors may take advantage of dips in stock prices and then hold for the longer term.</p><p>When viewing headlines in the pharma sector for 2012, readers see advances in treating diseases through stem cell therapy, immunotherapy, antibody drug conjugates and a host of other modern marvels that the healthcare sector could only dream of just a couple of short decades ago. However, improvement in harnessing the power of tried and true radioisotopes for treating cancers is showing a great deal of promise. Novel methods used to target tumors and reduce unwanted radiation exposure to patients, healthcare providers and even loved ones grow more advanced by the day. While not grabbing many headlines from the mainstream and higher profile therapies aforementioned as of yet, there are companies that may benefit investors in the near future as their trials and technologies advance and may soon begin sharing the spotlight. </p><p>Following is a diversified group of pharmaceutical companies with promising therapies addressing novel improvements in radioisotope treatment of cancer. There appears to only be marginal coverage and awareness of some of these companies, while others are mainstream, but their radiotherapy treatments are overshadowed by other &quot;sexier&quot; therapies in their pipelines.</p><p><strong>AREVA Med (ARVCF.PK)</strong> and <strong>Roche Holdings (RHHBY.PK)</strong> are two established companies that have recently <a href=""http://www.virtual-strategy.com/2012/07/27/roche-and-areva-med-join-forces-fight-against-cancer-and-create-novel-radio-immunotherapy"">joined forces</a> to develop a novel radioimmunotherapy platform for fighting cancer. On July 27th they announced their collaboration will &quot;<em>combine Roche's expertise in engineered antibodies with AREVA Med's proficiency in developing radioactive isotopes</em>.&quot; This partnership, combining two solid companies with a global presence in the pharmaceutical world, will likely bring new attention to radioisotope use in cancer treatment as it will be utilizing the Lead-212 radionuclide paired with highly specific antibodies to target and irradiate cancer cells while reducing systemic exposure throughout the patient's body and even closely-located healthcare providers and family members. </p><p>AREVA has already initiated a phase I trial using Lead-212 and a monoclonal antibody. The treatment is called Pb-TCMC-Trastuzumab, and the trial was initiated in July 2011 to treat intra-abdominal HER-2 expressed cancers. The trial is scheduled to run for two years, so the company is now at the half-way point in its duration. No updates have been posted on interim data, but a <a href=""http://arevamed.areva.com/EN/home-163/areva-meds-clinical-trial-now-enrolling-patients-at-uab-affiliates.html"">press release</a> on May 3rd announced an additional enrollment site. Lead-212 is a promising and unique isotope as it is a short range isotope with the dissipation of energy at an energy level minimizing exposure to surrounding tissue already. Utilized in a targeted radioimmunotherapy setting further reduces systemic exposure and should offer a much-improved safety profile over conventional radiotherapy treatments. Attention to the AREVA Med trial should increase in the coming months as the trial nears completion in addition to the new attention AREVA's and Roche's collaboration will likely bring to both companies and radiotherapy.</p><p><strong>Advanced Medical Isotopes Corporation (ADMD.OB)</strong>, also known as AMIC, made headlines in April of this year by obtaining <a href=""http://smallcapvoice.com/blog/amic-obtains-exclusive-license-for-injectable-radiogel-for-high-dose-interstitial-radiation-therapy/"">exclusive rights</a> to eight patents encompassing injectable radiogel for high-dose interstitial radiation therapy from <a href=""http://www.battelle.org/"">Battelle</a>. Like AREVA's technology, radiogel also works to reduce systemic exposure. However, the radiogel technology is likely a much lower cost treatment as it utilizes an injectable water-based polymer gel that delivers Yttrium-90 microspheres directly to the tumor tissue either transdermally or intraoperatively. Once inside the body and warming to the body's temperature, the gel polymerizes into a lattice that traps the radioactive Y-90 microspheres allowing irradiation of the surrounding tissue while not allowing the radiation to travel throughout the body. </p><p>Y-90 is a commonly-used isotope with a half-life of about <a href=""http://radioisotopes.pnnl.gov/yttrium-90.stm"">64 hours</a>, so it degrades quickly after it performs its initial irradiation. Although details on the company's plans for the technology haven't yet been revealed, AMIC's Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Robert Schenter, noted in the press release that &quot;<em>AMIC continues to develop the Yttrium-90 radiogel line with</em> <a href=""http://www.pnnl.gov/""><em>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</em></a><em>, operated by Battelle. We believe that this product optimizes treatment of radiation-resistant tumors in vivo. We expect the radiogel to become a therapeutic agent that provides physicians with the ability to effectively treat tumors that cannot be removed surgically or that cannot be treated by any other means</em>.&quot; Investors should watch for updates on this collaboration and make investment determinations as events unfold.</p><p>With many other <a href=""http://www.isotopeworld.com/isotope-products/"">radioisotope products</a> available on the company's website, manufacturing or supply partnerships along with any updates from the radiogel collaboration may be nice share price drivers for this budding company with an $20.6 million market cap as of market close on Tuesday the 31st. Currently operating at a loss, a <a href=""http://www.otcmarkets.com/edgar/GetFilingHtml?FilingID=8722324"">recent stock offering</a> should shore up the company's cash position at least for the interim and reduces the need for dilutive offerings at least in the near future.</p><p><strong>Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (SPPI)</strong> is having a phenomenal year with earnings growing at a huge pace largely in part due to colon cancer drug - Fusilev - sales. With $22.3 million in April and another $24.8 million in May, 2Q sales could reach $90 million according to <a href=""http://www.thestreet.com/story/11637583/1/spectrum-pharma-fusilev-drug-sales-smash-record-in-june.html?cm_ven=GOOGLEN"">estimates</a>. Spectrum's other approved therapy, ZEVALIN (administered as a combination of Rituxan and Y-90 ZEVALIN), should be of interest to shareholders looking for radioisotope investment exposure. A <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Spectrum-says-FDA-simplifies-apf-1601853536.html"">labeling change</a> in November of 2011 removed the requirement that patients undergo an &quot;imaging dose&quot; of ZEVALIN along with Rituxan and a subsequent imaging scan a couple of days later to observe how the drug is being distributed in their bodies. It wouldn't be until a week or two later when the patients would undergo therapeutic doses of ZEVALIN along with Rituxan. The labeling change removed the preliminary &quot;imaging dose&quot; and subsequent scan and is thought to benefit sales with the simplified and likely less expensive regimen. </p><p>More importantly, when fighting aggressive cancers, a &quot;week or two&quot; wait before beginning therapeutic treatment after simple imaging analyses may make a huge difference in prognosis for some patients. Like AMIC's newly-acquired radiogel technology, ZEVALIN also utilizes Y-90 with impressive trial data backing up its efficacy. An earlier <a href=""http://www.news-medical.net/news/20090905/Spectrums-ZEVALIN-expanded-label-receives-FDA-approval-for-treating-non-Hodgkine28099s-Lymphoma.aspx"">labeling change</a> for ZEVALIN in 2009 to include patients with previously untreated follicular non-Hodgkin's <a href=""http://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-Lymphoma.aspx"">Lymphoma</a> (NHL), who achieve a partial or complete response to first-line <a href=""http://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-Chemotherapy.aspx"">chemotherapy</a> noted phase III data stating &quot;<em>at 3.5 years of follow-up, the FIT trial demonstrated that when used as part of first-line chemotherapy for patients with follicular NHL, ZEVALIN significantly improved the median progression-free survival time from 18 months (control arm) to 38 months (ZEVALIN arm) (p&lt;0.0001)&quot; ... </em>a very strong statistical correlation. ZEVALIN is also in trials for Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma and with MGd in Rituximab-Refractory Low-Grade or Follicular B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma with impressive interim data. With an <a href=""http://www.sppirx.com/300-spectrum-products-portfolio.html"">exciting pipeline</a> and a host of catalysts from trial data ahead of them, Spectrum is a solid investment for those seeking exposure to modern radioisotope therapy in treating cancer with much upside still possible for this $914 million market cap pharmaceutical company.</p><p>Presented are exciting companies that may make good investments for those wishing to expand their portfolio exposure to include novel new advancements in radiotherapy for treating cancer. Each of these companies has something different to offer with a wide range of indications possible, diverse market capitalizations and varying company financial situations. </p><p>RHHBY and ARVCF are pharmaceutical entities with a global presence and represent a wide range of already-marketed products. SPPI's financials are improving almost daily as Fusilev and ZEVALIN sales continue to improve with awareness and expanding indications. ADMD is a development-phase company that is still operating at a loss but is beginning to diversify its business model beyond its product line of radioisotopes to include a clinical candidate that it may develop on its own, partner out to another, outright sell or use to tempt a pharmaceutical suitor. As modern radiotherapy continues to advance and start generating additional attention, any or all of the presented companies may benefit from or contribute to the new hope that is coming for cancer suffers needing novel, new radiotherapy treatments to fight cancer.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in [[ADMD.OB]] over the next 72 hours.</p>"
"634631","2012-06-04 08:20:10","5 Biotech Stocks That Could Be Included In The Russell 2000","<p>On May 31st, the Russell 2000 began to rebalance its holdings to determine which securities would be added to its index and which companies would be removed. To be included in the Russell 2000 is a great accomplishment for small companies and a provider of great opportunity. This index is often the benchmark for mutual funds with small cap strategies. Those investing in it are often required to purchase each security within the index. Due to the sheer size of the Russell 2000, it can provide significant buying pressure to all companies involved, even the ones that are the smallest in terms of weighted average in the index.</p><p>The average company in the Russell 2000 has a market cap of around $500 million. Each company in the index is required to have a stock price of at least $1 and a market capitalization of over $110 million (which was the smallest company included following the previous rebalancing). With that being said, let's take a look at five biotechnology companies that have returned large gains and could now be included in the index. The preliminary list will be <a href=""http://www.russell.com/US/news/press-release.aspx?link=press-releases/2012/PR20120301.htm"">announced</a> on June 8th, but there is no doubt that investors will be trying to determine which stocks could be included due to the benefit of its exposure.</p><p>Threshold Pharmaceuticals (THLD) has been the best performer of 2012 with a 470% gain. The company began 2012 with a market cap of under $70 million but is now valued at nearly $400 million. The reason is because of a global <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/THLD.O/key-developments/article/2474078"">agreement</a> with Merck KGaA (MKGAF.PK) to co-develop and commercialize its small molecule hypoxia-targeted drug, TH-302. Soon after the agreement, THLD <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/threshold-pharmaceuticals-doses-first-patient-in-clinical-trial-evaluating-th-302-in-multiple-myeloma-2012-03-14?reflink=MW_news_stmp"">announced</a> that its Phase IIb study met its primary endpoint with a 63% improvement in progression-free survival, creating even more optimism for this budding biotech.</p><p>As a result of Threshold's recent developments, its ability to maintain its valuation, and its potential, I expect its inclusion into the index. In fact, if the company is not included, it would most likely be a disappointment. In any case, the company has very significant institutional ownership. According to <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/threshold-pharmaceuticals-doses-first-patient-in-clinical-trial-evaluating-th-302-in-multiple-myeloma-2012-03-14?reflink=MW_news_stmp"">Reuters</a>, 50.10% of its shares are held by institutions with about 24.66% being held by insiders, a strong show of support for the company from within.</p><p>ImmunoCellular Therapeutics (IMUC) is the only stock on this list that I currently own. <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/542331-immunocellular-therapeutics-and-the-benefits-of-a-large-exchange"">I believe</a> we will hear of its inclusion into the index on June 8th. It has been a very eventful year for IMUC. The stock began the year with a market cap of $50 million, but now trades with a market cap of $147 million as of May 31st. The reason for its momentum has been the early results from its seemingly transcendent vaccine that treats glioblastoma, one of the most deadly forms of cancer. In a phase I trial, the results have been very impressive. When combined with recent developments, some have <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/488411-breaking-the-mold-of-oncology-drug-development"">suggested</a> that it could become a one-stop-shop for treating multiple cancers.</p><p>If you take time to research the company's lead candidate, ICT-107, and its early data for treating glioblastoma, you might think that you are reading the information incorrectly, because it is so effective. In the treatment of cancer, success is measured in months, but IMUC is rewriting all the books with a vaccine that is providing the best hope yet for glioblastoma patients. <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/immunocellular-therapeutics-to-present-long-term-survival-data-from-clinical-study-of-ict-107-in-glioblastoma-multiforme-at-american-society-of-clinical-oncology-meeting-2012-05-31"">Its latest data</a>, presented at last weekend's ASCO meeting, showed survival rates <i>over four years</i>. The results show that 38% of patients treated with ICT-107 survived over four years compared to 10% with standard care alone. </p><p>It's important to remember that this is a disease in which the average patient lives a little more than a year and 95% of patients die within five years. IMUC is now enrolling patients for its phase II trial and is having no problems, with 213 already enrolled of the 200 expected, a solid over enrollment. The company has also been <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/451551-immunocellular-therapeutics-patent-acquisition-paradigm-shift"">acquiring</a> intellectual property and patents over the last six months, and is testing the vaccine using even more antigens to determine just how successful this drug could be in cancer treatment.</p><p>If IMUC is added to the Russell 2000 it could create a number of possibilities. Up until last week, the company could not have qualified due to being an OTC stock, but the stock was just recently <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/621651-immunocellular-therapeutics-uplisting-to-nyse-could-immediately-open-many-doors"">uplisted</a> to the NYSE, making its timing almost perfect to be included in the index. The company has just 7.08% of its shares held by insiders most likely because it was just recently an OTC stock, and its institutional presence is minimal. Therefore, being included in the Russell index could reduce already large float, which I expect to occur with a frenzy of new institutional investors as a result of its data and IMUC's new NYSE listing.</p><p>Omeros Corporation (OMER) has returned a 150% gain in 2012 climbing to a market cap of more than $225 million. As a result of the company's large YTD gains, it is now eligible to be included in the Russell 2000. An inclusion in the index would be beneficial to the company since it has few institutional investors, with 16%. The stock trades with particularly low volume, so being included in the index will help by creating volume and adding exposure for the company.</p><p>Omeros has had a number of encouraging developments in 2012 leading to its rally. It <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/13/omeros-idUSL4E8ED61F20120313?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=rbssHealthcareNews&amp;rpc=43"">announced</a> successful results from its late-stage trial of OMS302, followed by a patent and <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/omeros-price-target-raised-17-160605144.html"">upgrades</a> for the stock. The company is now <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/OMER.O/key-developments/article/2511285"">enrolling</a> patients for its second late-stage trial and has significantly <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/adding-six-more-omeros-now-120000198.html"">increased</a> its number of class A orphan GPCR's, which are important for the development of new drugs.</p><p>Agenus Inc (AGEN) is my wildcard of the bunch that may or may not be included. The company barely met the market cap requirements at $118 million on May 31st and is particularly volatile. The company has come a long way in 2012 starting the year with a market cap of just $45 million, but now more than doubling due to impressive clinical data. AGEN focuses on several immunotherapy- based treatments and has the support of recent insiders who have purchased shares. These insiders hold nearly 12% of the shares with another 16% being held by institutional investors. The stock has traded significantly lower in May despite investors long awaiting the <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/319764-pharma-leaders-emerging-in-immunotherapy-approach-to-fighting-glioblastoma?source=yahoo"">ASCO</a> to hear updates from the company on several projects. AGEN is definitely a company worth watching over the next week as it could change directions abruptly with positive news from ASCO or an addition to the Russell 2000.</p><p>Anika Therapeutics (ANIK) is a company that barely missed the Russell 2000 last year and should have no problems in being added to the index in 2012. The company is under-the-radar and does not trade with the same level of momentum as other stocks on this list, but is a consistent performer. The stock has returned gains of 90% over the last year, including 40% gains YTD, and now trades with a market cap of $185 million. In my opinion the stock is undervalued, with significant revenue and a pipeline of products that could grow the company over the next few years, making it a smart purchase for Russell.</p><p>Anika is <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/589591-anika-therapeutics-a-bio-pharma-poised-for-long-term-gains"">attempting</a> to commercialize both of its revenue-producing products into new regions. It has posted five years of revenue growth and is now seeing vast improvements to its margins. It is a fundamentally strong company with very little debt and a large cash position considering the size of its company. Over the last year the company has <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/589591-anika-therapeutics-a-bio-pharma-poised-for-long-term-gains"">produced</a> revenue growth of more than 20% year-over-year, reporting $67.40 million during the last 12 months with $10 million in net income. The company is undervalued and under-the-radar. Its inclusion into the Russell 2000 could create new interest among investors and add to its already large 35% institutional ownership.</p><p>In conclusion, I believe each of these companies have the possibility of being included in the Russell 2000 following the rebalancing period. Each has seen a great deal of progress over the last year and would benefit from the added exposure and investors that would occur from being included in the index. As for which company would benefit the most, I'd say it's obvious that would be IMUC. It has a large float and very little in institutional investors due to recently being an OTC stock. The other companies on this list have strong insider and institutional presence already and will still benefit with the added liquidity. </p><p>Although I anticipate a great deal of new investors for IMUC in the next year due to its many merits, it would still benefit from the advantages provided as being a part of the Russell 2000, as would each company on this list.

Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.</em></p><p>Data from key trials of experimental treatments for melanoma brings good news for those affected by this deadly form of cancer. Following the disappointment from <strong>Vical's</strong> (VICL) <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/news-article/7311512-vical-phase-3-trial-of-allovectin-r-fails-to-meet-efficacy-endpoints"">failed Phase 3 study</a>, the development of melanoma treatments offer investors a solid opportunity with two different stocks.</p><p>Melanoma is certainly the deadliest form of skin cancer, accounting for 75% of all skin cancer related deaths. If caught early, it is highly treatable. When left too long, however, treatment options, until now, have been few.</p><p><strong>Big Pharma's Melanoma Vaccine</strong></p><p>There are two new drugs on the market targeting later-stage melanoma which have shown real promise. The first, from <strong>Amgen</strong> (AMGN), is TVEC (Talimogene Laherparepvec). The company <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/business/melanoma-drug-succeeds-in-late-stage-trial.html?_r=0"">announced</a> results of its stage 3 clinical trials - an improved survival rate of 16 percent for patients with advanced forms of the disease who were treated with TVEC, compared to 2 percent for those treated with a standard white blood cell-boosting drug. Recent analysis from market observers had indicated the company would need to demonstrate an improved survival rate of 15 percent or higher for the drug to have market viability. Amgen has met that threshold. Final survival rates for the drug trial are not expected until later this year, but this interim report has caught Wall Street's attention.</p><p>Amgen's head of global oncology development, David Chang, <a href=""http://provectuspharmaceuticalsinc.blogspot.com/2013/06/reuters-amgen-melanoma-drug-improved.html"">said</a> the company is currently discussing moving forward with the regulatory approval process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. So far, the only side effects reported have been mild, flu-like symptoms.</p><p>Amgen's TVEC is injected directly into the tumor where it replicates until the membranes of the cancer cells rupture and die. The drug then activates a systemic immune response to kill tumors throughout the body. This is the first time a virus-based treatment has shown success in treating any form of cancer.</p><p>Since the release of trial data, Amgen has traded consistently higher by an average of 6 percent, since this encouraging news was well received by Wall Street. This announcement, plus other cancer drug breakthroughs recently announced by Amgen (Xgeva for bone cancer, Trebananib for ovarian cancer), makes this an undervalued stock poised for growth. Clearly, Amgen is strengthening its oncology pipeline, and is making a strong push to acquire the cancer drug focused company <strong>Onyx Pharmaceuticals</strong> (ONXX). According to <a href=""https://twitter.com/bloombergtv/status/364838816135135232"">Bloomberg</a>, Amgen has upped its bid to $130 after being rejected at $120.</p><p>Amgen is aggressive in its pursuit of Onyx, and when you consider its pipeline of cancer products, it is easy to see why. Amgen has revenue of $17.66 billion over the last 12 months, but faces substantial growth concerns over the next few years. With the acquisition of Onyx, Amgen could add $3 billion in peak sales over a course of several years. Moreover, Xgeva and Trebananib will also boost the company's fundamentals, and then there's TVEC, a product with peak sales in excess of $1 billion. If Amgen successfully acquires Onyx, the company would have a diverse product offering in oncology, which could boost growth, and drive the stock significantly higher.</p><p><strong>Small Biotech's Therapeutic Approach</strong></p><p>The second therapy to enter the melanoma market is <strong>OncoSec Medical</strong> (ONCS.OB). OncoSec Medical has announced two advanced-stage treatments for melanoma. The company is developing advanced stage ImmunoPulse DNA-based immunotherapy and NeoPulse therapy to treat solid tumor cancers. OncoSec Medical's core technology is based upon its proprietary use of an electroporation platform to dramatically enhance the delivery and uptake of a locally delivered DNA-based immunocytokine (ImmunoPulse) or chemotherapeutic agent (NeoPulse). Early <a href=""http://oncosec.com/index.php/importance-of-durable-response-rate-for-cancer-treatment-trials/"">results</a> from its Phase 2 study are promising: 45 percent of treated lesions showed durable response at the six month mark of the study of patients with metastatic melanoma. The secondary marker for this study will evaluate safety and tolerability in addition to local response of the treated lesions at day 90.</p><p>ImmunoPulse utilizes the DNA plasmid interleukin-12 (IL-12), which is injected directly into the tumor. After injection, six needle-like electrodes are inserted into the skin around the tumor. Short pulses of 1,300 volts cause the pores of the cancer cell's membranes to temporarily open, allowing the DNA plasmid to enter the cells. Upon entry into the cells, the gene triggers the production and secretion of the IL-12 protein, which in turn identifies and eliminates cancerous cells as part of a natural immune response.</p><p>NeoPulse therapy uses the same delivery system as <span>ImmunoPulse to</span> deliver doses of bleomycin, a highly effective and highly toxic anti-cancer treatment. Extensive pre-clinical and clinical data from Phase 1 through Phase 4 clinical trials have demonstrated this delivery system is safe and highly effective in eradicating solid tumors, including those of melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and liver and pancreatic cancers. Along with the observable cancer cell destruction, this drug delivery method has also shown better quality of life benefits and swift healing of the wound site.</p><p>Normally bleomycin must be administered by intravenous infusion. Because this method targets cells inefficiently, practitioners must administer high doses of the drug to ensure adequate treatment of the cancer. Using NeoPulse to directly target the cancer cells, effective results can be achieved with as little as 1/20th of the traditional chemotherapy dose.</p><p>Given these extremely positive interim study results, OncoSec expects to complete the study in calendar 2013. Final analysis is anticipated in Q4 2013.</p><p>OncoSec is viewed by market analysts as having a promising future, especially if the company succeeds in getting its NeoPulse product introduced in Europe in 2013, following its signing of a partnering deal. The direction this company is taking into the treatment of various forms of cancer could lead to some major new products. The therapies developed by OncoSec seek to provide a method for less expensive and less invasive therapies for the treatment of some forms of cancer, minimizing detrimental effects such as surgery, systemic chemotherapy and immunotherapies.</p><p>However, if the company is unable to close partnership deals for its primary products ImmunoPulse and NeoPulse, it may also have to raise another $15 million later this year. These developments could critically affect the company's future.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Vical's Phase 3 study of Allovectin really puts a bulls-eye on Amgen and OncoSec. All three products were competing with each other in the advanced melanoma space. Now, with Allovectin no longer relevant, investors turn their attention to ImmunoPulse and TVEC. While Amgen is a large and diversified pharma company, TVEC is important in further boosting the company's oncology and growth line of products. With OncoSec, its electroporation technology is its primary driver, and while the company has many programs, late-stage melanoma is its latest and most promising in terms of revenue potential. Therefore, the competition between three companies becomes two, and it will be interesting to follow as a clear leader emerges.</p><p><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I am long [[AMGN]], [[ONCS.OB]].
